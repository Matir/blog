<p>BlogSecurity <a href="http://blogsecurity.net/wordpress/articles/article-230507/">is reporting</a> that a recent test showed 98% of Wordpress blogs are running on a version of the software with known vulnerabilities.  While the ones here on wordpress.com are certainly kept up to date, how about the thousands running on private servers?</p>
