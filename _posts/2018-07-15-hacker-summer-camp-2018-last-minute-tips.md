This is an update to my [planning
guide](/2018/05/26/hacker-summer-camp-2018-prep-guide.html) as we get closer to
Hacker Summer Camp.  (We're down to about 3 weeks now!)

## Planning Your Time ##

Schedules and details for events have begun to be released.  For example, we
have:

- [BSides Las Vegas Schedule](https://www.bsideslv.org/schedule/)
- [DEF CON 26 Speaker List](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-speakers.html) (No schedule yet!)
- [DEF CON 26 Villages](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-villages.html)
- [DEF CON 26 Demo Labs](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-demolabs.html)

It's time to take a look at the lists of events and times and start making your
"must do" list.  Resist the temptation to try to plan every minute -- first, you
won't be able to stick to it, and secondly, you'll feel like it doesn't leave
you time for spur of the moment events.  There will be conversations you want to
have, people you want to meet, or unscheduled activities you want to check out.

For your evening plans, there's no better source than the [DEFCON Parties
Calendar](http://18.defconparties.com/dcp).  Make sure you hydrate (and maybe
take a shower) before you head out for the evening.  Some of my favorites from
years past include:

- [The Rapid7 Party](https://www.rapid7.com/lp/blackhat-2018/index.php)
- [QueerCon Pool Party](https://www.queercon.org/blog/2018/07/13/queercon-15-schedule/)
- [BSidesLV Pool Party](https://www.bsideslv.org/events/)

## Dining & Restaurants ##

### Value Eats ###

There's a number of cheap eats in Las Vegas.  I'll focus on the ones in
relatively close proximity to the DEF CON hotels (Flamingo and Caesars) as well
as BSidesLV.  I'll also include things whose portion size/quality make up for
the (slight) cost.

### Buffets ###

Buffets on the strip are *not* cheap, despite what you might have heard.  They
also can have long lines at dinner time, so don't expect it to be quick in and
out.

Caesar's is home to the [Bacchanal
Buffet](https://www.caesars.com/caesars-palace/restaurants/bacchanal-buffet),
which has incredibly high quality options (and is one of the top-rated buffets
in Vegas), but is a pretty expensive meal.  The
lines are likely to be very bad during DEF CON, so I suggest going to another
hotel if you're absolutely looking for a buffet.

[The Buffet](http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/Dining/CasualDining/TheBuffet) at the
Wynn (literally, it's named "The Buffet") has one of the best dessert/pastry
selections along with great entrees and sides.  It's also not cheap, but will
not suffer from the peak rush at Caesars.

### Moderate Options ###

### Top Shelf ###

Okay, to be honest, I don't really do the top shelf restaurants myself.  If
you're into that sort of thing, you might want to check out the usual guides
(Michelin, etc.)

A few I'm familiar with:

- Bouchon
