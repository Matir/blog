This is an update to my [planning
guide](/2018/05/26/hacker-summer-camp-2018-prep-guide.html) as we get closer to
Hacker Summer Camp.  (We're down to about 3 weeks now!)

## Planning Your Time ##

Schedules and details for events have begun to be released.  For example, we
have:

- [BSides Las Vegas Schedule](https://www.bsideslv.org/schedule/)
- [DEF CON 26 Speaker List](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-speakers.html) (No schedule yet!)
- [DEF CON 26 Villages](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-villages.html)
- [DEF CON 26 Demo Labs](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-demolabs.html)

It's time to take a look at the lists of events and times and start making your
"must do" list.  Resist the temptation to try to plan every minute -- first, you
won't be able to stick to it, and secondly, you'll feel like it doesn't leave
you time for spur of the moment events.  There will be conversations you want to
have, people you want to meet, or unscheduled activities you want to check out.

For your evening plans, there's no better source than the [DEFCON Parties
Calendar](http://18.defconparties.com/dcp).  Make sure you hydrate (and maybe
take a shower) before you head out for the evening.  Some of my favorites from
years past include:

- [The Rapid7 Party](https://www.rapid7.com/lp/blackhat-2018/index.php)
- [QueerCon Pool Party](https://www.queercon.org/blog/2018/07/13/queercon-15-schedule/)
- [BSidesLV Pool Party](https://www.bsideslv.org/events/)

## Dining & Restaurants ##

### Value Eats ###

There's a number of cheap eats in Las Vegas.  I covered some of the cheapest in
my first post, but I wanted to add a few more notes.  I'll focus on the ones in
relatively close proximity to the DEF CON hotels (Flamingo and Caesars) as well
as BSidesLV.  I'll also include things whose portion size/quality make up for
the (slight) cost.

Quick bites (fast food):

- Earl of Sandwich
- Shake Shack
- Caesar's Food Court

Fast casual dining (sit down):

- [Hash House a Go Go](https://www.hashhouseagogo.com/)
- [Carnegie Deli at the Mirage](https://www.mirage.com/en/restaurants/carnegie-delicatessen.html) -
  Biggest portions I think I've ever seen.

### Buffets ###

Buffets on the strip are *not* cheap, despite what you might have heard.  They
also can have long lines at dinner time, so don't expect it to be quick in and
out.

- Caesar's Palace is home to the [Bacchanal
  Buffet](https://www.caesars.com/caesars-palace/restaurants/bacchanal-buffet),
  which has incredibly high quality options (and is one of the top-rated buffets
  in Vegas), but is a pretty expensive meal.  The
  lines are likely to be very bad during DEF CON, so I suggest going to another
  hotel if you're absolutely looking for a buffet.

- Flamingo's [Paradise Garden
  Buffet](https://www.caesars.com/flamingo-las-vegas/restaurants/paradise-garden-buffet)
  is a middle-of-the-road buffet, with decent, but not outstanding food.  It is
  dramatically cheaper than at Caesar's, so might be a good option for
  all-you-can-eat at a lower price.

- Next door to Caesar's is the Mirage, which hosts a buffet named
  [Cravings](https://www.mirage.com/en/restaurants/cravings.html). Unlike many
  Vegas buffets, beverages here are self-service,so you'll never be wanting for
  a drink refill, but also don't expect many servers around.  I haven't been
  here myself, but the menus generally look unimpressive.

- Though not particularly close by, the [Wicked
  Spoon](https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/restaurants/wicked-spoon) is one of
  the best regarded buffets in Las Vegas, with gourmet dishes made from the best
  ingredients. They also offer brunch 7 days a week, which appeals to some.

- [The Buffet](http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/Dining/CasualDining/TheBuffet) at the
  Wynn (literally, it's named "The Buffet") has one of the best dessert/pastry
  selections along with great entrees and sides.  It's also not cheap, but will
  not suffer from the peak rush at Caesars.

### Nicer Options ###

These are the kind of restaurants where you'll want more than a t-shirt and
jeans (and almost certainly no shorts)!  Reservations are recommended.  Vegas is
full of these restaurants, but a few of my favorites include:

- [Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill](https://www.caesars.com/caesars-palace/restaurants/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill)
- [Spago by Wolfgang Puck](http://wolfgangpuck.com/dining/spago-lv/)
- [Lupo by Wolfgang Puck](http://wolfgangpuck.com/dining/lupo-by-wolfgang-puck-las-vegas/)

### Top Shelf ###

Okay, to be honest, I don't really do the top shelf restaurants myself.  If
you're into that sort of thing, you might want to check out the usual guides
(Michelin, etc.)

A few I'm familiar with:

- Bouchon
- Mon Ami Gabi
- Restaurant Guy Savoy
- Nobu

## Packing Reminders ##

### Handling the Weather ###

It's going to be hot, so be prepared.  I strongly encourage bringing a reusable
water bottle like the [aluminum bottle](https://amzn.to/2mm8jYz) I'll be
sporting, or a [Nalgene bottle](https://amzn.to/2Juo6xC).  Some will even go
with a [bladder-style backpack](https://amzn.to/2Nlmbxz).  I'll also bring along
a [cooling towel](https://amzn.to/2mqdMgR), which work surprisingly well!  (They
use evaporation to cool you down.)

### Hacking All the Things ###

Maybe you're into hacking and would like to give it a shot while at DEF CON.
There's a bunch of different options here.  If you want to bring a laptop with
maximum security, I can't encourage bringing a Chromebook enough.  At the budget
end of the spectrum, I really like the [Acer Chromebook
11](https://amzn.to/2uFQY0l).  For a mid-range Chromebook, I like the
[C302CA](https://amzn.to/2utbphX).  At the top end, there's nothing quite like
the [Pixelbook](https://amzn.to/2usuz7q), which is currently 25% off.

While you can get lots of tech in the vendor area, you might want to consider
bringing a [C232HM](https://amzn.to/2zRsJ5w) universal cable, or at least a
[UART Cable](https://amzn.to/2NmYuVU). This will at least get you basic
capabilties to play around with any electronic badges you might come across.

If you're into other specific activities (SDR, etc.), you'll want to bring the
appropriate gear.

## Conclusion ##

It's time to start making your day-to-day plans.  Many have suggested leaving
lots of room for flexibility and just going with the flow, which is not a bad
idea at all.  Have fun!
