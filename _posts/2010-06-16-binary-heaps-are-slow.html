<p>Most CS professors would probably take a look at the title of this post and assume it's a senseless rant or otherwise misdirected, but it turns out it's true: binary heaps are slow on real computers (not the theoretical systems often discussed in CS classrooms).Â  Poul-Henning Kamp, author of the Varnish HTTP Accelerator, <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1814327">discovered and wrote about this for the ACM</a>.</p>
