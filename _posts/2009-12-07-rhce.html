<p>Generally speaking, I try not to push my ego on here too much.  It's big enough on its own.  However, I feel like this is a pretty major accomplishment for myself, and I haven't posted in a while, so I thought I'd throw it up there.  As of this past Friday, I am now a Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)â„¢!  This is without a doubt the hardest test I've taken, as a "practical" (hands-on) exam.  No multiple-choice guessing here.</p>
<p>I'll probably lean towards working on an LPIC-1 certification next.</p>
