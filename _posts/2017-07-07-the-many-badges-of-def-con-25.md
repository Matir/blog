If you follow DEF CON news at all, you'll know that there's
[been some kind of issue with the
badges](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-25/dc-25-news.html#dc25badgeannounce).
Now, obviously there will still be badges for DEF CON, but when the community
heard this, they responded by upping their game.

What do I mean by this?  Well, badge hacking has long been a DEF CON tradition,
but in the past few years, we've seen more and more unofficial badges appearing
at DEF CON.  This year seems to be a massive upswing, and while I'm sure some of
that was in progress before the badge announcement, I believe at least some of
it is the community response to the DEF CON badge issue.

I've tried to collect information about all the unofficial badges I can find,
but I'd imagine there are many more that I haven't heard about, or whose creator
just isn't talking about it.  I know for a fact at least one such private badge
exists!

Know of another badge?  Ping me on [Twitter (@Matir)](https://twitter.com/matir)
and I'll update.

## Available for Sale ##

This includes badges that were available for sale at some point, even if now
sold out.  Basically, if at any point you could exchange cash, credit, bitcoin,
litecoin, ethereum, gold ingots, or any other form of value for the badge, I'm
putting it here.  (I'd call it "commercial", but most of these are a labor of
love and the money just helps the creator not go broke with their labors.)
