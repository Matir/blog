<p>I don't know how I missed it before, but I found a great backup tool today.  It's <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/backupninja">BackupNinja</a>.  It's stupidly simple to set up to back up a small number of machines.  It's no centralized backup system like bacula, but for a single server or two (like I have) it seems far better than a "roll your own" solution.</p>
<p>So, a big Christmas thank you to the BackupNinja devs.</p>
