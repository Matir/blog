<p>To the Ubuntu Georgia Local Community:</p>
<p>Around September of last year, I began to take over from Nick Ali and others in coordinating the activities of the Georgia LoCo.  Unfortunately, I haven't done very well at that.  I have not set up any events or otherwise taken steps to help the LoCo grow.  However, it's a new year and it's time for a new tack.  It's time for the LoCo to get out there and get active.  I have a large stash of 10.10 CDs for us to distribute and I'd like to try to get events scheduled at least every 2-3 months.  I'd also like to start new partnerships with other like-minded organizations.  Hopefully, I'll be able to turn a new leaf and jump-start activity in the organization. I'd like to invite anyone with thoughts on the future of the LoCo to contribute their ideas, and I'll do what I can to get them rolling.</p>
<p>I'd like to start thinking about a 11.04/Natty release party.  Thoughts, ideas, desires, suggestions?</p>
