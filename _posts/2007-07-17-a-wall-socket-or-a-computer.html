<p>Amazingly, very basic computers can now <a href="http://parthsuthar.com/derive/2007/06/20/a-computer-so-small-it-fits-in-a-wall-socket/">fit in a wall socket</a>: it looks like a bunch of ports, and it is, but it also computes!  Pretty amazing considering that even 30 years ago computers required a dedicated room.  No word on price, but looks pretty cool.</p>
