<p>Things have been very busy since I started my job at Kennesaw State University.  Because my department uses Drupal extensively for producing dynamic websites, I decided it was time to migrate my own content to Drupal.  So my intent is that this replaces my old WordPress blog and also provides a place to host projects and other work.</p>
