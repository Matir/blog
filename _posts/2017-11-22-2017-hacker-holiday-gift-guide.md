I've been thinking about gifts for Hackers and Makers lately as the holiday
season arrives.  I decided I'd build a public list of some of my favorite things
(and perhaps some things I'd like myself as well!)  I'll break it down into a
few categories for different kinds of hackers (and different kinds of gifters as
well).  Prices are current as of writing, but not something I'll be updating.

## Stocking Stuffers (Under about $20)

### Yubico U2F Security Key

[![Yubico U2F Security Key](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLKA0D8&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.right}](//amzn.to/2yYa6aR)

The [U2F Security Key by Yubico](https://amzn.to/2yi1IYB) is a hardware 2-factor
authentication token compatible with the Fido Alliance Universal 2-Factor (U2F)
standard.  This includes sites like Google (GMail), Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket,
Dropbox and Facebook.  Unlike SMS, U2F can't be intercepted by an adversary
(even in countries with government-run telcos).  It continues to work with a
dead battery in your smartphone, and is backed by a hardware secure element.
It still won't protect you against malware on your computer, but it's a dramatic
increase in security for most threat models.  Everyone should have two security
keys: one for daily use, and a backup (already enrolled) in a safe place in case
something happens to the primary.  [$17 at Amazon](https://amzn.to/2yi1IYB)

### Red Team Field Manual

[![Red Team Field Manual](/img/blog/gifts2017/rtfm.jpg){:.left}](//amzn.to/2jFLzog)

The [Red Team Field Manual](//amzn.to/2jFLzog) is a versatile guide for
anyone who quickly needs to perform security tasks on both Windows and Linux.
Though mostly targeted towards penetration testers & red teamers, this is useful
for system administrators who spend most of their time on one platform but need
to work on the other occasionally, or for budding infosec students getting used
to working on their non-native platform.  It provides command lines for a number
of different tasks on both platforms, including:

  * Networking Commands (ip address, routing table, etc.)
  * Common file operations (search, replace, extract, hash, etc.)
  * Common file locations (password hashes, configuration, etc.)
  * Basic scripting operations (bash, python, powershell)

This is not reading material -- it's strictly a reference, but in a quite handy
format & form factor.  [$9 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2jFLzog)

### iFixit Essentials Toolkit

[![iFixit Essentials Toolkit](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01MRNIFR6&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.right}](//amzn.to/2hDbt7Q)

The [iFixit Essentials Toolkit](//amzn.to/2hDbt7Q) is a smaller version of
my favorite toolkit, the [iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit](//amzn.to/2zSxGck).  It
contains a high quality screwdriver handle, the most frequently used screwdriver
bits, and several tools useful for opening all kinds of devices, including
smartphones, routers, and pretty much any other IoT device out there.  It comes
in a nice case that uses neodymium magnets to hold it closed.  It also supports
iFixit, who produce some really high quality teardowns and post it all online
for free.  [$19.99 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2hDbt7Q)

## For Penetration Testers & Red Teamers

### WiFi Pineapple Nano

[![WiFi Pineapple Nano](/img/blog/gifts2017/pineapple_nano.jpg){:.right}](https://hakshop.com/products/wifi-pineapple)

Hak5's [WiFi Pineapple](https://hakshop.com/products/wifi-pineapple) may be the
best-known piece of hacking hardware out there.  In the current generation, the
Nano offers two radios built-in, making it perfect for a repeater style setup.
In addition to the use as an attack device, allowing penetration testers to
conduct wireless audits, attacks on clients, and other kinds of applied attacks,
the Pineapple is also great for the hacker on the go.  I often use mine to
connect to hotel WiFi on one radio, perform a VPN link back to a VPN server, and
provide a WPA2 hotspot on the other radio.  Few other travel APs can provide
this kind of functionality, so bringing the Pineapple Nano on the road with me
always gives a lot of flexibility and options.  [$99.99 at
HakShop](https://hakshop.com/products/wifi-pineapple)

### Packet Squirrel

[![Packet Squirrel](/img/blog/gifts2017/packet_squirrel.jpg){:.left}](https://hakshop.com/products/packet-squirrel)

If the WiFi Pineapple is a Swiss Army Knife for WiFi networks, then the [Packet
Squirrel](https://hakshop.com/products/packet-squirrel) is that for wired
ethernet.  As a physical man-in-the-middle (MitM) device, the Packet Squirrel
allows you to perform network attacks, modify traffic, or just VPN your own
devices.  (Even multiple devices if a network switch is connected behind the
Packet Squirrel.)  While the Wifi Pineapple may be the classic Hak5 tool
(perhaps excepting the USB rubber ducky), the Packet Squirrel is the newest
member of the family.  I haven't had a chance to do much with mine yet, but it
looks promising and has a ton of cool features.  [$59.99 at
HakShop](https://hakshop.com/products/packet-squirrel)

### Red Team: How to Succeed By Thinking Like the Enemy

[![Red Team Book](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0465048943&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.right}](//amzn.to/2B4thBA)

Not just about Information Security Red Teaming, [this
book](//amzn.to/2B4thBA) by Micah Zenko describes the way in which
adversarial simulation helps organizations strengthen their posture.  By taking
a look at the role played by assumed attackers, it helps demonstrate how
understanding the enemy leads to be better defenses, and how playing the enemy
leads to finding previously unknown weaknesses in defenses.  [$20.32 at
Amazon](//amzn.to/2B4thBA)

### Unauthorised Access: Physical Penetration Testing for IT Security Teams

[![Unauthorised Access](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0470747617&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.left}](//amzn.to/2hJnlFA)

Red Teaming takes on many forms, and understanding physical security is
important for any penetration tester or red teamer, even if he or she does not
actually execute physical attacks.  Knowing about the possibilities in the
physical space helps to understand risks and compensating controls.
[Unauthorised Access: Physical Penetration Testing for IT Security
Teams](//amzn.to/2hJnlFA) by Will Allsopp describes the basics of
penetration testing physical access controls (mostly buildings and datacenters)
and will help you to look at these controls in an entirely new light.  [$25.43
at Amazon](//amzn.to/2hJnlFA)

## For Hardware Hackers & Electronics Makers

### Brymen BM235 Multimeter (EEVBlog Model)

[![BM235](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01JZ1ADCO&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.left}](//amzn.to/2jFuOcN)

When doing any electronics work, whether it's making, debugging, reverse
engineering, or any other form of hacking, being able to take voltage, current,
resistance and other readings is critical.  The typical tool of choice for this
is the handheld multimeter, and the [Brymen BM235](//amzn.to/2jFuOcN) is my
favorite multimeter.  While there are surely better multimeters out there (the
[Fluke 87V](//amzn.to/2B46vtj) is probably the best known multimeter for
electronics work), this Brymen offers most of the features at a significantly
lower price.  Most hobbyists and hardware hackers don't need the resolution of
the 87V or similar multimeters, but the Brymen still offers good functionality,
and most importantly, is a quality multimeter with proper safety features.
[$125 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2jFuOcN)

### Dremel Cordless Rotary Tool

[![Dremel 8220](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B008DRY5AI&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.left}](//amzn.to/2z0fvhK)

The [Dremel 8220](//amzn.to/2z0fvhK) is a 12V cordless rotary tool.  You
can use it to cut, grind, or drill all kinds of materials.  I've used mine to
cut openings in project boxes for several electronics projects, to open
ultrasonically welded electronics devices, and even the occasional home
improvement project.  While they have corded models as well, I find the cordless
model more convenient, especially when working on my patio.  (Being in Silicon
Valley, I don't exactly have room for a full workshop.) [$99.00 at
Amazon](//amzn.to/2z0fvhK)

### TUMPA Multi-Protocol Adapter

[![TUMPA](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0156ML5LY&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.right}](//amzn.to/2zUvvFp)

The [TIAO USB Multi-Protocol Adapter](//amzn.to/2zUvvFp), or TUMPA for
short, is a multi-protocol interface, allowing for JTAG, SPI, UART, RS-232, and
SWD.  All of this is useful for interfacing with all kinds of hardware, like
dumping flash, using JTAG to examine the running state of a CPU, or even just
basic UART interfacing.  Like so many of these multi-interface systems, it uses
an FTDI FT-2232H chip, but this one has neatly designed interface connections
and a great support wiki.  [$39.99 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2yZoyQ7)

### Ubertooth One

[![Ubertooth One](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B007R9UPHA&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.left}](//amzn.to/2hLzmKs)

Given the proliferation of Bluetooth devices, the [Ubertooth
One](//amzn.to/2hLzmKs) is an essential device for assessing modern
Internet of Things devices.  The Ubertooth is essentially a Software Defined
Radio (SDR) for bluetooth, allowing the security professional to examine,
capture, modify, and replay bluetooth frames.  Find out what your gadgets are
sending to each other or look for bugs in the firmware itself.
[$127.95 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2hLzmKs)


### Adafruit & Sparkfun Gift Certificates

Adafruit and Sparkfun are retailers of a variety of maker & hardware hacking
supplies.  Both have a wide variety of tools and parts and both support Open
Source Hardware and the maker movement.  Get an
[Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3331) or
[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13726) Gift Certificate if you
don't know what your favorite maker might want.

## For InfoSec Students & N00bs

### Hacking: The Art of Exploitation

[![Hacking: TAoE](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1593271441&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.right}](//amzn.to/2B3By8J)

[Hacking: The Art of Exploitation](//amzn.to/2B3By8J) may not be the most
recent book, but it's still a good read for those new to the binary exploitation
areas of security.  It's an excellent introduction, and contains lots of
still-relevant material, even if it doesn't include bypasses for all the latest
mitigations.  [$39.55 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2B3By8J)

### DT2000 Hardware Encrypted Flash Drive

[![DT2000](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01AKAE6E0&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.left}](//amzn.to/2jJfBrp)

The [DT2000](//amzn.to/2jJfBrp) is a flash drive from Kingston that
features a keypad to allow the entry of a PIN allowing access to the
hardware-encrypted contents.  Contents are encrypted by 256 bit AES, and I have
it on good word that this device has fairly properly implemented their
encryption.  They're obviously significantly more expensive than stock flash
drives, but the encryption and the case make them a great place to protect
important documents and files including backups of password managers (you do use
a password manager, don't you?), financial records, medical records, GPG keys,
and other sensitive data.  I use an older USB 2.0 encrypted flash drive, and
have been looking a lot at an upgrade, and the DT2000 would be at the top of my
list.  [$124.88 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2jJfBrp)

### Offensive Security Training

There are few things I'm prouder of than holding both the
[OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/)
and
[OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/)
certifications.  They teach hands-on practical Offensive Security (hence the
name) and do an incredible job of it, especially for those who learn best by
doing.  With fully immersive labs and exams that require *doing* instead of
answering some multiple choice questions, these really push security
professionals to the next level.  If you know someone who can *"Try Harder"*,
this is a great gift to get for them.

### Raspberry Pi 3

[![Raspberry Pi 3](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01C6Q2GSY&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.right}](//amzn.to/2zV8Et9)

Ever since the Raspberry Pi first hit the market, it's been a popular option
with Hackers and Makers.  This [starter kit](//amzn.to/2zV8Et9) gives
everything you need to get started with the Raspberry Pi 3, which is the latest
iteration of the full-sized Raspberry Pi.  The 3 includes integrated WiFi and
Bluetooth, so no more need for a dongle for that.  One of the nicest features
with the Raspberry Pi is how trivially you can switch your operating system:
just swap to another MicroSD card.  You can have one card with Raspbian, another
with Kali, etc.  Likewise, if you manage to terribly misconfigure your system,
you can either move the MicroSD to another computer to fix it or just reflash it
to a stock system.  Though the Raspberry Pi 3 alone is
[$35](//amzn.to/2j9OJNn), the kit with a case, power supply, heatsinks,
MicroSD card, etc., is [$69.99 at Amazon](//amzn.to/2zV8Et9).

## Geek & Hacker Apparel

Despite the Security Weekly suggestion to [Hack
Naked](https://securityweekly.com/category/hack-naked/), there are a couple of
providers of fine hacking apparel to be found because most hackerspaces and
offices do require clothing:

* [0Day Clothing](https://www.zerodayclothing.com/)
* [Hacker Stickers](https://www.hackerstickers.com/)

## Young Hackers & Makers

You'll have to make your own decisions about the age appropriateness of each of
the options here for the young hackers & makers in your life.  I'm clearly not
an expert in that area, but decided I'd share my thoughts anyway.  (Plus, many
of these items are fun for older hackers exploring new areas too!)

### Circuit Playground Express

[![Circuit Playground Express](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0764NQ1WW&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.right}](//amzn.to/2zTHX8o)

For the first foray into embedded systems and microcontrollers, I recommend the
[Circuit Playground Express](//amzn.to/2zTHX8o) from Adafruit.  It allows
programming the device in MicroPython and loading your code is as simple as
plugging in and seeing it appear as a USB mass storage device.  Save your
micropython program to the device, hit reset, and see it run.  It contains 10
Neopixel-style RGB LEDs, a thermometer, light sensor, accelerometer, sound
sensor, speaker, buttons, switches, and more!  It does require a bit of
understanding of electronics, but it's a great start into programming for the
physical world.  [$32.99 on Amazon](//amzn.to/2zTHX8o) or [$24.95 direct
from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333)

### Lego Mindstorms EV3

[![Lego Mindstorms EV3](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWER3XY&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=systemovecom-20){:.left}](//amzn.to/2BfAAWQ)

The [LEGO Mindstorms EV3](//amzn.to/2BfAAWQ) is the robots kit I wish I had
when I was a kid.  While I did eventually get an original Mindstorms kit, the
modern LEGO Robotics kit has far more features and has three kinds of sensors
and two kinds of motors.  Instructions for building multiple robots are
included.  If you (or your young hacker) gets bored of the built-in firmware and
programming interface, it turns out the EV3 programmable brick is actually a
fully-featured Debian Linux computer, for which a [community has sprung up and
built a replacement firmware](http://www.ev3dev.org/) allowing so much more.
Imagine a swarm of EV3-powered robots.  The kit is pricey, but it's good for
most ages and might inspire the next generation of robotics engineers.  [$349.95
at Amazon](//amzn.to/2BfAAWQ)
