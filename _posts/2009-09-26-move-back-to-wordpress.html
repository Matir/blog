<p>As you may have noticed, my site (Tuxteam.com) has moved back to Wordpress.  While I still support Drupal (and use it at work), it did not meet my needs for my site.  Specifically, the ability to create per-tag feeds was lacking, and it used a LOT of RAM for such a simple site.  (This site runs on a Linode-360.)  The theme is a stock community theme, but I hope to be switching that around some in the near future.  I'm also going to be starting a couple of new things on here, but we'll see how those work out.</p>
