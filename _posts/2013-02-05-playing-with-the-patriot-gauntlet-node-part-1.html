<p>I recently picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KW61XK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008KW61XK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=systemovecom-20">Patriot Gauntlet Node</a> just to take a look at it.  Playing with the device, it seemed to be a pretty straightforward wireless SoC with a hard drive interface.  Many, if not most, of these embedded SoCs use Linux as their operating system, so I decided to go a bit further and see what was going on.</p>
<p>I headed over to the Patriot website and downloaded the firmware for the Gauntlet Node, unzipped the file, and ran <a href="https://code.google.com/p/binwalk/">binwalk</a> against it.  (Binwalk is an awesome tool that essentially runs 'file' with a special magic file against every possible byte offset to find the parts of a firmware image.)</p>

This confirmed my suspicions -- a Linux OS resides on the device.  (And no, before you look, there's no GPL sources to be found on the Patriot site...)  So, let's see what's inside.  Since the uImage header identified the compression as lzma, and the section at 0x40 is LZMA compressed (and first), it seems likely to be a kernel image.  A quick <tt>dd if=PA21_1.2.4.5.bin of=kernel.lzma bs=64 skip=1;lzma -d kernel.lzma</tt> left me with a kernel image, confirmed by running strings on the file.  The kernel by itself isn't very interesting -- userspace can tell us a lot more about how the device works.  Let's look for a filesystem -- binwalk has identified two JFFS2 (common on embedded devices) filesystems.  Unfortunately, it turns out that neither of those is actually a JFFS2 filesystem (binwalk does get the occasional false positive).  So let's look at the kernel some more, maybe we can find some clues.  Let's look for the kernel command line:</p>
<pre>$ strings img.1.2.4.5 | grep 'root='
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
console=ttyS1,57600n8 root=/dev/ram0
console=ttyS1,57600n8 root=/dev/ram0</pre><p>
/dev/ram0 suggests we're booting from an initrd of some sort, maybe in the same lzma image?  Let's try binwalk on the kernel image itself... That nets us a lot of noise, dozens of lzma and JFFS2 signatures, mostly obvious false positives (massive dictionary sizes, uncompressed sizes, etc.).  But the very last image found, an lzma image, has a dictionary size of exactly 1048576 (1MB), so seems like a likely candidate.  Another dd and lzma later, and I've got a file that 'file' identifies as a cpio archive (standard for an initrd).  <tt>cpio -idv --no-absolute-filenames</tt> gets me a nice directory structure of a linux root filesystem.  Finally something to work with!</p>
<p>I poked around the filesystem a little, and I'll have more on that later, but the most interesting thing I've found so far is a file named killprocess.cgi in /etc_ro/web/cgi-bin.  It turns out that given the right argument, this triggers a busybox telnetd.  That's right, it just takes a web request to get telnet!  <a href="http://10.10.10.254/cgi-bin/killprocess.cgi?service">http://10.10.10.254/cgi-bin/killprocess.cgi?service</a> (using the default IP) starts telnetd right up.  admin/admin logs you right in.</p>
