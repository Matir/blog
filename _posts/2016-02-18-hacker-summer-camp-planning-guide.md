A couple of coworkers who have never been to [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org),
[BSides Las Vegas](https://www.bsideslv.org/) or [Black
Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/) (collectively, "Hacker Summer Camp")
asked me about planning their first trips, so I decided to collect my tips here.
I'm going to be splitting my advice into two parts: this planning guide for
travel/scheduling/registration information, and a
Hacker Summer Camp survival guide for advice that's more relevant while you're
at the conferences.

### Manage Your Energy ###

There's a lot to do, the hours tend to be long, and unless you're used to both
the environment (typically hot, this is Las Vegas in August!) and the crowds,
it's going to burn a lot more energy than you're going to expect.  Two years
ago, I attended all 3 of the conferences, helped run a company suite, and taught
classes at R00tz (formerly DEF CON Kids).  This was a serious mistake on my
part, and failure to *manage my energy* adequately.  I ended up not getting as
much out of any of the events as I should have, and when I returned, I ended up
sick for several days due to the toll of these events on my body.  It was more
than a full week afterwards before I felt fully recovered.

If this is your first time, don't try to do everything.  Firstly, it's just not
possible, and secondly, you will destroy yourself trying to do so.  Prioritize,
and make yourself okay with the fact that some things you'll just miss out on.
For myself, the most important parts of the week are:

- **Activities** -- I learn more by doing than by listening to some speaker try
  to tell you what he did in 45 minutes.  I typically play in the BSides LV CTF
  and Capture the Packet at DEF CON.  Others might find the DEF CON Shoot to
  their liking.  (I'd probably like it too, but always end up busy on Thursday.)
- **Villages** -- Villages are a set of topical/related presentations and
  activities that are presented by people who are *very* into the particular
  topic.  I'll usually visit the tamper-evident village, lockpicking village,
  wireless village, and whatever is new.  If you've never tried picking a lock,
  it's really interesting just to see how the process goes, and the guys in the
  lockpicking village can tell you anything you wanted to know about any lock.
- **Networking** -- One of the most important aspects of DEF CON is networking,
  and it's not just about lining up your next job.  This industry is *full* of
  back-channel connections that help you get information, securely report a
  vulnerability, or help you find a solution to a problem.  You'll find out
  things that aren't publicly known, learn who to talk to about esoteric
  technology, and generally meet some great people.
- **Talks** -- Talks are good and are obviously a core part of all of the
  conferences, but to me, they take a back seat to the above categories.  This
  isn't because I don't like the talks (I do!) but because the other categories
  require your in-person presence and participation.  Unless you want to ask the
  presenter a question, the talk won't be recorded, or you really want to know
  about it before the recording becomes available, being there in person adds
  very little to the value of a talk.
- **Parties** -- Rumor has it that DEF CON, Black Hat, and BSides may also have
  parties.  These rumors are completely unfounded.  There is absolutely no
  partying, live music, alcohol consumption, or any other fun to be had in Las
  Vegas during these events.

### Scheduling ###

**Black Hat** Briefings are Wednesday and Thursday, with trainings either
Saturday-Sunday or Monday-Tuesday (or sometimes covering both for bigger
trainings).  **BSides LV** is Tuesday and Wednesday, with a pretty full schedule
both days.  **DEF CON** is Thursday-Sunday, but Thursday doesn't really get
started until the afternoon (and even then, the villages have not historically
been open), and things start to wind down a little bit Sunday afternoon, so
Friday and Saturday are the "core" for DEF CON.

### Travel ###

I'm told driving to DEF CON can be a great deal of fun when done with the right
people, but I haven't managed to do so myself.  I imagine doing it yourself
isn't much fun.  Do keep in mind that you'll be driving through the desert, so a
reliable vehicle is a must, and bring water, just in case.

Las Vegas, as a center of tourist travel, has relatively convenient air travel
options from pretty much anywhere.  From the SF Bay Area, there's several direct
flights a day from any of the 3 local airports, and on several airlines, and
it's just over an hour gate-to-gate.  Keep an eye on airfare early and look for
deals -- booking early can easily save more than $100 on airfare.  When
planning, particularly for your departure from Las Vegas, please keep in mind
that DEF CON travelers on Sunday evening *are numerous enough* to cause significant delay
at airport check-in and security, so allow extra time.

### Hotel ###

There's two schools of thought on hotel: stay at the conference hotel (for one
of the conferences, if doing more than one), or stay *away* from the conference
hotel.  I personally prefer the DEF CON hotel (i.e., Bally's or Paris for DEF
CON 24), but I'll review the pros/cons of each so you can make up your own mind:

##### Staying at the Conference Hotel #####

- **(Pro)** You can easily get back to your hotel room after evening "social
  activities".
- **(Pro)** It's easy to dump stuff in your room so you don't have to carry
  everything around.  (This can be somewhat mitigated if you have a friend
  staying there.)
- **(Pro)** It's fun to meet random people from the con around the hotel.
- **(Pro)** Usually, DEF CON sets up "DEF CON TV" to the rooms in the DEF CON
  hotels, which will live stream the talks, so if there's one you really want to
  see but the room is slammed, you can watch it from your room.  (Or you can
  hang out with some new friends, drink a couple of beers, and watch talks from
  your room.)
- **(Con)** Everywhere at the hotel will be busy.  Everywhere.  Every bar,
  restaurant, and shop, will be slammed at all hours.  Seriously.

##### Staying Elsewhere #####

- **(Pro)** You get a break by getting away from the conference.  This can be a
  good option for introverts.  (Though I personally find going to my room enough
  for that -- I usually need to do so about once per day to mentally recharge.)
- **(Pro)** You can often find much better deals off site, especially if you
  start looking early.  DEF CON even has room block that is close by, but not
  Paris/Bally's, and is generally cheaper than those hotels.
- **(Pro)** Food options will be much less busy than at the conference hotel.
- **(Con)** You'll need to get back and forth to the conference, which may
  negate some of the potential savings.  (You may think you can walk, but
  temperatures during this week often exceed 100&deg;F (38&deg;C))

### Other Things to Be Aware Of ###

- As of DEF CON 24, registration is $240, cash only at the door.  Since DEF CON
  20, pricing has fairly consistently been ($year * $10) -- so $200 at DC 20,
  $220 at DC 22, $230 at DC 23, and this year will be $240 for DC 24.
  While historically, there have been crazy waits for badges,
  registration got much better with DEF CON 23.
- Currently, even numbered years get electronic badges, and odd numbered years
  get non-electronic badges.  The electronic badges tend to run out, so you may
  want to make sure you get a badge on Thursday (they're usually good through
  Thursday) if that's important to you.
- International travelers: Las Vegas basically runs on tips.  Nearly everyone
  expects to be tipped.
- Be an active participant.  I've personally spent too much time not
  participating: not talking, not engaging, not doing.  You won't get the most
  out of this week by being a wallflower.

### Resources ###

There are a lot of resources for finding out more about what's going on.
Obviously, the conference websites are your first stop, but as DEF CON is a
large community event, there's also more opportunities out there:

- [/r/defcon](https://reddit.com/r/defcon)
- [@defcon](https://twitter.com/defcon)
- [DEF CON Forums](https://forum.defcon.org/)

### Conclusion ###

I hope this proves helpful to those new to DEF CON.  Get out there, meet people,
and have fun.  If you're a seasoned veteran and see some suggestions I've
missed, please email me or find me on twitter:
[@matir](https://twitter.com/matir) with your suggestion and I'll add it.

Thanks to the [@dc404](https://twitter.com/dc404) group for some of the
additions and suggestions!
