The [Threads BreakIn CTF](http://felicity.iiit.ac.in/threads/breakin) hosted by IIIT Hyderabad has just wrapped up.  Shadow Cats did pretty well, placing 16th overall, completing 22/33 challenges, especially considering we only had 2 guys playing this CTF.  Mad props goes out to [Dan](http://lockboxx.blogspot.com/), and here's hoping for a bigger team turnout next week for [Ghost in the Shellcode](http://ghostintheshellcode.com/).

I'm going to be doing some writeups of a couple of the challenges I thought were particularly interesting, as well as some topical information inspired by the CTF.  I'll be linking to the writeups below as they get published.

* [LD_PRELOAD for Binary Analysis](/2014/01/13/ld_preload-for-binary-analysis/)
* Modifying binaries for reversing
* Calling Card (Misc 5)
