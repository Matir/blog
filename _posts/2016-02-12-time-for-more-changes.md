This isn't the first time I've changed blogging platforms, and it probably won't
be the last.  I got tired of having to do maintenance on a blogging platform, so
I decided to look for something lightweight.  Enter
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Jekyll is basically a static website compiler -- it takes templates and content
and produces static HTML output.  No databases, no runtimes, no attack surface
(beyond a static webserver).  Given that I don't mind writing in Markdown (in
fact, I was using a Markdown plugin for Mezzanine), it seemed like a perfect
fit.  I wrote a quick script to get content out of Mezzanine/Django and export
as HTML/Markdown, then spent some time tweaking the settings and theme (based on
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)).

I'm going to be setting a goal to blog at least once a week, so watch this space
for updates.  And if you notice something odd going on (I know there are some
issues with old posts and code blocks) please email me or ping me on Twitter.
