	Last night, Ann and I attended a local performance of "Avenue Q" at the <a href="http://www.horizontheatre.com/">Horizon Theatre Company</a> with some people from my work.  I wasn't sure what it would be like, but the 175-seat theater is a perfect setting.  We got there just before showtime, so got seats in the very back, but even those seats have a great view.  The entire theater can only be described as an intimate setting.</p>

	While I was familiar with a few of the songs in Avenue Q, I had no idea how well the play would click with my sense of humor.  It was, without a doubt, the funniest thing I have ever seen.  I never thought I would say that I empathized with puppets, but I did in Avenue Q.  The performers at Horizon were incredibly talented and passionate professionals who put on a truly top-notch show.  If you've wanted to see Avenue Q, I can't recommend enough checking out Horizon before the show ends July 3rd.</p>
