It's been a little bit since I last updated, and it's been a busy time.  I did want to take a quick moment to update and note that I accomplished something I'm pretty proud of.  As of Christmas Eve, I'm now an Offensive Security Certified Professional.

Even though I've been working in security for more than two years, the lab and exam were still a challenge.  Given that I mostly deal with web security at work, it was a great change to have a lab environment of more than 50 machines to attack.  Perhaps most significantly, it gave me an opportunity to fight back a little bit of the impostor syndrome I'm perpetually afflicted with.
