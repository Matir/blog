DEF CON, of course, is the main event of Hacker Summer Camp for me.  It's the
largest gathering of hackers in the world, and it's the only opportunity I get
to see some of the people I know in the industry.  It's also the most hands-on
of all of the conferences I've ever attended, and the people running the
villages clearly know their stuff and are super passionate about their area.
Nowhere do I see so much raw talent and excitement for the hacker spirit as at
DEF CON.

This year was the first year at Caesar's Palace and quite frankly, it showed.  Traffic
control reminded me of the first year at Bally's/Paris: as best as they could do
without any data, but still far from optimal.  Additionally, Dark Tangent
pointed out that they were expecting 6% growth, but ended up closer to 20%.
That's thousands extra.  The rule that they do not sell out and everyone gets
through the door is not without its downsides.

Overall, this year was incredible for me personally.  Though I attended no main
track talks, I made it to a couple of Sky Talks and some village talks, as well
as a bunch of village activities.  I met a bunch of interesting people who are
working on interesting technical things, which is great because it reminds me
why I got into this industry in the first place and what I want to be doing in
the future.

The IoT village was excellent, but I wish I had gotten to it earlier to
participate in the IoT CTF -- it looked like a lot of fun, and their physical
target range wasn't something you see everyday.  They had everything from
cheap bluetooth devices to the Google Home and Amazon Alexa, and I believe this
is a reflection of where we'll see the future growth in security -- the IoT
isn't a passing fad, and we'll have millions of low-cost devices deployed and
not properly managed.  There's no time like the present to get security to the
front and center of the IoT device design process.
