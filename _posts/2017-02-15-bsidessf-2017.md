BSidesSF 2017 was, by far, the best yet.  I've been to the last 5 or so, and had
a blast at almost every one.  This year, I was super busy -- gave a talk, ran a
workshop, and I was one of the organizers for the BSidesSF CTF.  I've posted
[the summary and slides for my talk](projects/assessing_embedded_devices)
and I'll update the video link once it gets posted.

I think it's important to thank the BSidesSF organizers -- they did a phenomenal
job with an even bigger venue and I think everyone loved it.  It was clearly a
success, and I can only imagine how much work it takes to plan something like
this.

It's also important to note that our perennial venue, DNA Lounge, (except that
one year we don't talk about) is [having some money
problems](https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2016/12/19.html).
Apparently you can't spend more than you bring in each year.  This is the venue
that, in addition to hosting BSidesSF, also hosts
[Cyberdelia](https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2017/02-14.html).  This is a
venue that allows all kinds of independent art and events to thrive in one of
the most expensive cities in the country.  I encourage you to reach out and go
to a show, buy some pizza, or just donate to their Patreon.  If my encouragement
is not enough, how about some from [Razor and
Blade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTZUv6NT3b4)?

Again, big thanks to BSidesSF and DNA Lounge for such a successful event!
