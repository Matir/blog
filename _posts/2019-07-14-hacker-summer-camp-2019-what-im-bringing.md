I've begun to think about what I'll take to Hacker Summer Camp this year, and I
thought I'd share some of it as part of my Hacker Summer Camp blog post series.
I hope it will be useful to veterans, but particularly to first timers who might
have no idea what to expect -- as that's how I felt my first time.

## General Packing ##

## Tech Gear ##

## Shipping ##

There are some consumables where I just find it easier to ship to my hotel.
Note that the hotel *will* charge you for receiving a package, but I still find
it cheaper/easier to have these things delivered directly.
