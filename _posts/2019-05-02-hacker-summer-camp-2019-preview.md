Every year, I try to distill some of the changes, events, and information
surrounding the big week of computer security conferences in Las Vegas.  This
week, including Black Hat, BSides Las Vegas, and DEF CON, is what some refer to
as "Hacker Summer Camp" and is likely the largest gathering of computer security
professionals and hackers each year.

## The Conferences ##

### DEF CON ###

DEF CON is the conference that started it all.  Since 1993, Dark Tangent has
been bringing hackers together to hang out in the Las Vegas summer.  DEF CON is
also, by far, the largest of the 3 conferences, with somewhere upwards of 20,000
attendees.  Nearly every talk will be completely packed, with many forming a
line as long as an hour in advance.  Elevators will be crowded, hallways will be
crowded, and it will be crazy -- and I love every minute of it!

For me, the best part of DEF CON are the villages.  These are specialized areas
providing an opportunity for individuals with particular interests to get
together and focus on that area of hacking.  Examples of villages include the
IoT village (where I had the [privilege to speak last
year](/2018/08/10/im-the-one-who-doesnt-knock-unlocking-doors-from-the-network.html)),
the lockpicking village, the tamper-evident village, the packet capture village,
and many, many more.  Last year there were so many villages I didn't even get a
chance to see them all.

Many of the villages offer hands-on activities, which are some of the best
opportunities at DEF CON.  For example, the Packet Capture village has "Capture
the Packet", a network forensics challenge, the IoT village has an IoT CTF, the
lockpicking village has hands-on lockpicking, and the soldering skills village
has soldering irons set up along with kits to practice -- or even challenge --
your soldering skills.  These are just a few of the ways you can get hands-on
practice in specialized security or hacking domains directly from some of the
most passionate individuals in those specializations.

## Where to Stay ##

As usual, there are generally two schools of thought on where to stay: either at
one of the con hotels, or off-site.  Both have Pros and Cons, and I'll break out
some of the more common considerations below.  Neither option is "right" or
"wrong" and it often comes down to whether or not you want to be as immersed in
the culture of the event as possible, or want to have a break from it by going
back to your offsite hotel.

### Staying at the Con Hotels ###

**Pros**:

* Easy to quickly drop things off/grab things in your room.
* Talks are streamed to the hotel rooms (roomcon)
* No long walks/cab lines in the heat to get to your room

For BSides Las Vegas, an additional pair of pros includes the two badges for the
conference as well as the fact that the entire hotel is reserved for BSides
attendees (during the conference) so you get to hang with like-minded hackers.

**Cons**:

* Usually more expensive, unless booked very early.
* Elevators are often overcrowded.

For DEF CON, there's the added con of Caesar's history of "health and welfare
checks" (see below).

### Staying Offsite ###

**Pros**:

* Cheaper hotels available (or AirBnB)
* More options (loyalty points, etc.)
* Quieter hotels/less shenanigans

**Cons**:

* Need to go back and forth to the cons

Admittedly, the pros/cons of staying offsite are nearly the inverse of the
staying onsite, so it's very much a matter of prioritizing for you.

### Caesar's Properties and "Health and Welfare Checks" ###

Note that there were a lot of issues regarding Caesar's Entertainment Group
employees (and potentially impostors) entering guest rooms last year.  Caesar's
maintains that these room checks will be conducted by security and are necessary
for guest safety.  While this is highly debateable, and many in the security
community (including myself) consider these checks an invasion of personal
privacy, it appears they will be continuing these checks.  [DEF CON links to

FAQ.](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/caesars-room-check-policy.pdf)
Please note that all three of the hotels where DEF CON is being held this year
(Paris, Bally's, and Planet Hollywood) are members of the Caesar's Entertainment
Group, so I would expect the same behavior at those locations.  If you want to
ensure your room stays secure when occupied, you could consider a [Veritas
Traveller's Doorstop](http://www.leevalley.com/us/gifts/page.aspx?p=40812) as
recommended by [Deviant
Ollam](https://twitter.com/deviantollam/status/1029124425927483392).

I would also consider putting anything valuable in hard-sided luggage and
locking the luggage.  It keeps it out of sight, and requires someone either
overtly destroys the luggage or steals the entire thing, either of which is
significantly more obvious than just grabbing something.  I'm likely going to
get a [Pelican 1510](https://amzn.to/2Jf4uB2) or similar for my electronics.
That would require a dramatic entry or is likely to be caught on security
cameras if taken by an employee.  (There are, of course, no guarantees.)

If you completely want to avoid this, I would check that your alternative hotel
has no such policy.  Many of the Casino-hotels have gone this way, so you might
want to consider a non-Casino venue, such as the Hilton Grand Vacations, the
Westin Las Vegas, or Marriott's Grand Chateau.  As of writing, I could not find
any information about a "health and welfare" check for any of them, but if
you're concerned, I would consider calling and checking in advance.
