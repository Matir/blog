<p>A lot of people probably thought that AOL would be a company to keep with the times.  Apparently not, since <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/05/aols_password_puzzler.html">their system only uses the first 8 characters of a password</a>, silently discarding anything else.  Sounds like a sense of false security to me.</p>
