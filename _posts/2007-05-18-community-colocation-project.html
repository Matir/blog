<p>Several cities have a "community colocation project", such as the <a href="http://www.sfccp.net/">San Francisco Community Colocation Project</a>.  I feel that Atlanta is in a perfect place to join this movement.</p>
<p>Community colocation projects (CCPs) are a non-profit datacenter for non-profity entities and individuals.  This would be a great opportunity for an advancement of Open source projects and for the community in Atlanta and the metro area.  Atlanta is the center of high-tech development for the Southeastern United States, and as such, should become a leader in the Open Source arena.</p>
<p>Thoughts and comments are appreciated.</p>
