<p>In no particular order, and certainly not a conclusive list, but there are some things that really bother me that I'll call Big Picture Problems:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Defecit Spending and the growth of the national debt</li>
<li>The continued plundering of limited resources and other environmental issues</li>
<li>Politicians</li>
<li>Overpopulation</li>
<li>Nuclear proliferation</li>
<li>The continued abatement of freedoms in the name of "security"</li>
<li>The ever-increasing power of corporations over people</li>
<li>Lack of universal healthcare</li>
</ul><p>Accordingly, I'd like to say thanks to the hard-working individuals and organizations who work to improve things, including:</p>
<ul><li>The ACLU</li>
<li>The EFF</li>
<li>Greenpeace</li>
<li>Citizens Against Government Waste</li>
</ul>
