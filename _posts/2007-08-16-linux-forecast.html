<p>The Linux Foundation has started publishing a <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Linux_Weather_Forecast">Linux Weather Forecast</a> -- a summary of ongoing development in the Linux community and predictions for forthcoming developments and technologies.Â  It's a very cool snapshot/summary of development, and it's presented in a very understandable manner.</p>
