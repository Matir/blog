<p>I installed the beta version of <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) about two weeks ago.  It has since gone to stable and been deployed on thousands of computers worldwide.  So what do I think about it?</p>
<p><strong>It's amazing.</strong>  Everything worked out of the box.  The only thing I had to change was have it mount some of my secondary partitions (I could've done that during the install, but didn't want to mess with them then).   Installing beryl to get a little eye candy was a mere 5 minute process.</p>
<p>I was running Gentoo before this.  Don't get me wrong, Gentoo is great as well, but I'd switched most of my other machines to Ubuntu and decided to standardize.  Also, waiting on the compiles <strong>does</strong> get a bit old on Gentoo.  While I've run quite a few Linux distributions over the decade I've been using Linux, I've only seriously run 4: Slackware, Debian, Gentoo, and Ubuntu.  Ubuntu is by far the best.  It has  the wonderful Debian package management, great functionality/interface, and gets updated very regularly.  Plus it has the stability of a corporation (Canonical LTD) behind it to help push things and keep the development flowing.</p>
