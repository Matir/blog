<p>The Micahville blog has <a href="http://www.micahville.com/2007/07/27/debunking-linux-and-its-relationship-with-gaming/">an excellent article</a> on why Linux should not be dismissed as a serious gaming platform.  It lists 17 awesome games for Linux, many of which I have not even heard of.  I'm going to give some of them a try later.  I'd really like to hook up a joystick to my computer again to hit up FlightGear.</p>
