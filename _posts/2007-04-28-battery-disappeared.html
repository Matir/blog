<p>On my Latitude D620 (my work laptop) the battery has "disappeared".  Both Linux and the BIOS show that no battery in installed.  That being said, the battery charge light is on when the battery is in, and the light is off if I remove the battery, so there must be SOMETHING there.  Any thoughts welcome.</p>
