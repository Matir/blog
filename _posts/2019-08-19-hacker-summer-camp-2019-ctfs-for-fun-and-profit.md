Okay, I'm back from Summer Camp and have caught up (slightly) on life.  I had
the privilege of giving a talk at BSidesLV entitled "CTFs for Fun and Profit:
Playing Games to Build Your Skills." I wanted to post a quick
[link to my slides](/static/attachments/ctfs_for_fun_and_profit.pdf) and talk
about the IoT CTF I had the chance to play.

I played in the IoT Village CTF at DEF CON, which was interesting because it
uses real-world devices with real-world vulnerabilities instead of the typical
made-up challenges in a CTF.  On the other hand, I'm a little disappointed that
it seems pretty similar (maybe even the same) year-to-year, not providing much
variety or new learning experiences if you've played before.
