<p>Tom (my boss) and I arrived in Chicago last night for Drupalcon 2011.  I will be blogging my notes from training classes &amp; sessions, but I will not be placing them in the "planet" category, so they will not be syndicated on Planet Ubuntu &amp; Planet Georgia, unless there is content significantly relevant to the Ubuntu community.  (If you're interested in my Drupalcon 2011 coverage, please check my site or subscribe to its feed.)</p>
<p>Many of the notes will be intended for my later consumption, but I'm hoping they may also help others address the same issues.  Let me know if there are confusing parts you'd like me to expand upon.</p>
