<p>
	I have the coolest <a href="https://simplepapercrafting.wordpress.com">wife</a> because, although today is our first anniversary, she not only allowed, but encouraged, me to attend DrupalCamp Atlanta.  Hopefully I learn something useful.  :)</p>
<p>
	I love her very much... and I'm not just saying that because she reads this blog.</p>
<p>
	(Oh, and don't worry, we'll be spending the evening together.)</p>
