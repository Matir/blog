<p>According to <a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-13739_1-9769645-46.html">an article on cnet.com</a>, the manner in which Comcast is filtering BitTorrent traffic may, in fact, be criminal.  Comcast is sending forged RST (reset) packets to the end-user, which may qualify as impersonating with the intent to profit.  (Criminal Impersonation in the 2nd Degree).  Whether or not this plays out in court remains to be seen.</p>
