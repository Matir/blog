As I'm helping to organize the [BSides San Francisco
CTF](https://ctf.bsidessf.net) this weekend, I thought I'd share a little primer
for CTFs for those who have not gotten into them before.

## What is a CTF?

I suspect that most people in the information security ("cybersecurity") space
have already heard of Capture the Flag (or CTF) competitions, but in case you
haven't, I wanted to provide a short overview.

Capture the Flag competitions are a timed and scored set of security-related
challenges.  They may take many forms and durations, but there are some pretty
common styles, and the majority of CTFs are 24-72 hours long.  Some are
associated with conferences or other events, while others are run entirely
online.

The most common style of CTF is called "**Jeopardy Style**", named after the TV
show.  In these CTFs, players complete challenges from an assortment of
categories to earn points.  Most often, completing each challenge awards the
"flag" that is entered into the scoreboard to receive points.  These may be run
for individual players or teams of players.

Another style is the "**Attack-Defense CTF**", in which teams of players have a
network to defend while also being able to attack the networks of other players.
They may involve stealing flags off the opponent's network or planting ones own
flags to earn points.

Most players' first CTF experience will be with a Jeopardy-style CTF
competition, such as the one we're running this weekend, so I'll focus on that
style for the remainder of this post.

## Common Categories

While CTFs may present challenges that are widely varied, there are some
categories that are fairly common across the board.
