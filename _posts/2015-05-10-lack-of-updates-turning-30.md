I've been disappointed with myself for a while for not updating more often.  It's been months!  I'd been pushing myself to update regularly, but I also only want to update with genuine content.  Social networks are places where I can just place random thoughts, this is a place for meaningful content that will (hopefully) be useful to others.  (Though the jury's still out on that one.)

Part of the reason for the lack of updates is burnout.  For one reason or another, I just haven't been feeling myself for a while, and so haven't been doing as many interesting things.  Some of this burnout is due to the nature of things I've been doing at work, but it wouldn't be fair to blame all of it on work.

I've also been dealing with some (potential) health issues.  Mostly it's been a case of symptoms with no obvious cause, which is even more maddening to me.  Despite reassurances from doctors, I can't help but have a nagging feeling that something is actually wrong.  It's quite the distraction, psychologically.

So, in more timely news, I've made the transition from "20s" to "30s" (two weeks ago).  When I was 25, I posted asking if 25 was old, because I felt like I hadn't accomplished anything.  Though I think I've accomplished a few things in the interceding time, I'm not convinced it was 5 quality years worth.  I need to get better at prioritizing my time and making sure that I use my time in good ways.  I'd like to make sure I'm either doing something I enjoy, something meaningful, or something helpful to others.  Anything else is just a waste of precious time.
