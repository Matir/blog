I probably should've posted this days ago, but on Monday, I'll be teaching a 
[Web Security workshop](https://bsidessf2016.sched.org/event/6ARY/exploiting-broken-webapps)
at [BSides San Francisco](https://bsidessf.com/) along with
[Niru](https://twitter.com/N4ranj4).  While capacity is limited, we may have a
few additional seats, so if you're interested, drop by and see what we've got.

Workshop description:

Web applications can fail in a variety of ways, from Cross-Site Scripting to SQL Injection and more. Join us for a look at a variety of common web vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting, Cross-Site Request Forgery, Weak Authentication, Logic Errors, and more -- and an opportunity to test your web hacking skills against a simulated online bank. Weâ€™ll be covering the vulnerabilities from the ground up, but a basic understanding of web applications (i.e., HTTP, HTML, and JavaScript) and browsers would be useful background.

Participants will need to bring a laptop. Prior experience with server-side programming and an understanding of how web apps are built is recommended.
