<p>There's a lot of issues going on around OOXML these days.  Specifically, there's <a href="http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/online/news/ooxml_documentation_iso_concerned">alledged copyright violations</a> by posting the OOXML specs by members of the Boycott Novell group.  I want to address a specific issue: why is something applying for ISO standardization so secret?</p>
<p>International standards (e.g., ISO) should be open and royalty-free.  It's ridiculous if there's a "standard" that's locked in to a single vendor.  Can someone explain any sanity to this situation?</p>
