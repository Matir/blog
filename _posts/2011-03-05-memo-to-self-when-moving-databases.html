<p>As a memo to myself, and in case others aren't aware of this:</p>
<p>If you move the entirety of a mysql server (e.g., all databases, especially the "mysql" database) to a new Debian-based (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) server, you need to make sure the debian-sys-maint user is created or updated.</p>
<p>If moving from a non-Debian-ish environment, try: </p>
<pre>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'debian-sys-maint'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '--password--' WITH GRANT OPTION;</pre><p> where "--password--" comes from /etc/mysql/debian.cnf.</p>
<p>If moving from another Debian-ish environment, copy the password from /etc/mysql/debian.cnf on the old server to the same file on the new server.</p>
<p>HTH.</p>
