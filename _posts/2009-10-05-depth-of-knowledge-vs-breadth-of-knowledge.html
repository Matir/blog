<p>In a lot of circumstances, it can be useful to have a wide breadth of knowledge: that is, to know a little about a lot of things.  It's useful in my job, where I am the System Administrator/DBA/developer/etc.</p>
<p>That being said, I feel like I need to increase my depth of knowledge in one or more areas in order to be more useful to the Open Source and Ubuntu communities.  I feel as though my contributions are not as significant as I'd like them to be, but I'm also not sure in which direction to take them.</p>
<p>So how can someone who knows a little about a lot learn a lot about a little to be more useful in the community?</p>
