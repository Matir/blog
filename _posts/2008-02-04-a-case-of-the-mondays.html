<p>It seems like I have been hit with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">a case of the mondays.</a>  My job (end user tech support at my school) sucks.  I don't mind helping people -- I love it in fact -- but I feel like a trained monkey sometimes.  90% of my time is spent resetting passwords.</p>
<p>In any case,  I am usually able to combat this with some of my entertainment sites (see below for the curious), but lately I've been looking more for a project to work on.  My learning process is heavily tied to getting something done -- I can read a book on Python (or whatever), but for me to understand it, I need a real-world project using it to work on.  No "hello world" application can grab my interest enough.  Perhaps it's some form of ADD.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean?  I'm becoming restless.  I need a project.  I've tried looking into becoming a MOTU, but I'm not sure I fully understand the process (and it's hard to fix bugs in apps I don't even use).  Something practical and useful, but not so large as to stretch into months or years.  (At least, I'd like something I can make progress on before months or years.)</p>
<p>Any ideas on ways to combat this crappy boredom?</p>
