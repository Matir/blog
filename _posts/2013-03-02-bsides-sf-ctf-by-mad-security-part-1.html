<p>Last weekend I was at BSides SF and had the opportunity to participate in the Capture the Flag competition run by MAD Security/The Hacker Academy. I was able to clear 6 of the levels, and thought I'd write them up here to share my experience. Most of this is from my memory, so there might be a few inaccuracies, but the intent is to share the general concepts, not the specifics.</p>
<p><b>Backstory</b><br />
	Nick, a vocal opponent of the Absurdistani government, has disappeared, and you need to find out what happened to him.</p>
<p><b>Level 1: Information Gathering</b><br />
	Level one was basically just information gathering -- obtain Nick's personal email address and the password for his "myface.com" account. The first part was incredibly straightforward: go to myface.com and find the directory of members. Click on Nick's name and there's his email address. Obtaining his password is only another step away -- let's pretend we've forgotten our password, and get some password reset questions. Hrrm, what might the name of his dog be? I'm sure he guards that infor... oh, wait, what's the caption on the picture of a dog? And for bonus points, it turns out that myface.com stores passwords in plaintext, so they can just spit his out to us!</p>
<p><b>Level 2: Private Files</b><br />
	This one had a bit of a curve ball to it: Nick, an early adopter of Cloudbox, might have some private files stored there. (Find his private file and provide the md5sum of the file as well as part of the contents.) Let's go check out the site. We'll start with the obvious and try to login with Nick's username and password from myface.com (who doesn't love some password reuse?) -- but no such luck. Well, we can try creating an account and poking about a bit. We see that our account is at <a href="http://cloudbox.com/account/292">http://cloudbox.com/account/292</a>. What happens if we change around the number at the end? Oh, look -- it's other people's accounts! Ok, so we can enumerate accounts, and find an account number "2" that has a video in it. Well, they did say he was an early adopter, so we download the file, md5sum, and... wrong answer! Crap, it's not that easy. With a little perseverance, you can discover a couple of other accounts with files -- might as well grab them all and give them a try. OK, one of the files appears to be gibberish, so it's probably encrypted, so let's try that as the secret file -- and the md5sum checks out.</p>
<p>Now how do we recover the secrets within?  Running "file" on the encrypted file just tells us that it's "data", which is not surprising for an encrypted file.  Maybe a hexdump of the file will give us a clue:</p>

</pre><p>Salted__ looks meaningful... I seem to recall that using OpenSSL enc produces that at the beginning of the file, but I'm not sure.  How can we confirm that?  Let's run a small test and find out.</p>
<pre>$ echo "foo" | openssl enc -des3 | hexdump -C
enter des-ede3-cbc encryption password:
Verifying - enter des-ede3-cbc encryption password:

</pre><p>Looks like roughly the same thing, so we're probably on the right track, but we don't have a key.  The level mentions that Nick's roots are from a web image hosting service, so maybe there's something interesting with that.  I'd grabbed the images from Nick's myface page, so I figured I'd see if there was anything to those.  "strings" is a handy utility for these sorts of things, and I quickly discovered the same thing in the EXIF portion of each of the images: <tt>Encryption Key: e82e1beefdaad9c</tt>.  Could it really be that easy?</p>
<p>There's one more piece of information we need: what algorithm did Nick use for his encryption?  I don't see anything pointing me in the right direction, but there's a handful of commonly used algorithms, so I just tried those: des3, aes-128-cbc, aes-256-cbc, aes-192-cbc and each time, I got "bad decrypt" until I tried rc4, where there was success!  I found a text file containing what appeared to be 3 passwords (actual passwords munged):</p>
