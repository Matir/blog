<p>Only yesterday I discovered the amazing webcomic <a href="http://questionablecontent.net">Questionable Content</a>.  I don't know where I've been that I've missed the superior wit of Jeph Jacques, but it's worth a read for just about anyone.  He's got over 1700 strips there, and I've read through the first ~900 in the past two days.  Yes, it's that good.  I've literally LOLed, which has led to Ann giving me several strange looks.  But it's well worth it.</p>
<p>I figured I'd post a short list of my favorite webcomics -- I encourage everyone to check them out!</p>
