<p>As many may know, I'm a moderator over at <a href="http://linuxquestions.org">LinuxQuestions.org</a>.Â  We sponsor several conferences, and as a result are able to offer <a href="http://jeremy.linuxquestions.org/2007/04/30/linux-and-open-source-conference-discount-codes/trackback/">exclusive discounts</a>.</p>
