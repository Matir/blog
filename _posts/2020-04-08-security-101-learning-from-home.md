Outside, there's a pandemic.  We're being asked to stay indoors, shelter in
place, and avoid social contact.  Conferences are cancelled, live trainings are
out of the question.  Some businesses are closing (hopefully temporarily) and
there are unfortunate layoffs and furloughs across the board.  It's a tough
time.

Rather than dwell on the negative, focusing on something else can help you get
through this mentally.  Learning something or growing your skills can both help
take away from the anxiety of the situation and also help you come out of this a
better person.  Whether you're just getting started in security or looking to
advance your career, or just looking to become more security-aware as an
individual, there are some great options for learning from home.  My lists below
are by no means comprehensive -- there's more content than I can shake a stick
at.  However, these are intended to be good for beginners and have a diverse set
of content.  If you know of something I should have included, please reach out.

Some of these options are free or freemium -- if you have the means, I'd
strongly encourage you to pay for access and support those who are putting it
together.

* [**PentesterLab**](https://pentesterlab.com/) has a number of free exercises, and
  dozens available with a paid PRO subscription.  ($35 for 3 months for
  students, or $20/month for professionals.)  The exercises in this environment
  are very well laid out, including things like basic Unix skills all the way up
  to complex crypto challenges.  Each challenge is well-documented and works
  reliably, and the challenges are arranged in "badges" helping you find the
  right progression for your skills.
* [**Hack The Box**](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) is the premiere site for hosted
  hackable VMs.  They provide a VPN connection to an environment with a number
  of challenge servers, each of which has a "User" and "Root" flag to be
  captured.  [I've played](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/27111)
  through 26 of their boxes as well as 22 challenges.  They definitely have
  content for every skill level if your interest is penetration testing.  If you
  plan to take the OSCP, these boxes are very similar in "spirit" to the OSCP
  lab boxes.  Free tier gets access to all current boxes, pro gets you less busy
  servers as well as access to retired boxes.
* Stanford University has made [**CS 253 - Web
  Security**](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/) available online for free.
  It includes slides, video, readings, and 3 of the course assignments,
  accessible to anyone who would like to do this.
* [**CryptoPals**](https://cryptopals.com/) is a set of Cryptography challenges
  hosted by NCC Group.  These are a progressive set of challenges to break
  various broken cryptography implementations, and require no pre-knowledge of
  crypto or advanced mathematics.  (Some math is required, but it's described as
  9th grade level mathematics.)
* [**CryptoHack**](https://cryptohack.org/) is similar to CryptoPals, but with a
  CTF-style flair to it.  This is another "learn crypto by breaking it"
  opportunity.
* [**Exploit.Education**](https://exploit.education/) is a set of challenges for
  vulnerability analysis/discovery, predominantly of memory corruption
  vulnerabilities.  These are intended as a progressive set of VMs to attack and
  work your way through.  Includes opportunities for ARM and ARM64 exploitation.
* Why not take the opportunity to [build your own **home
  lab**](/2017/10/24/building-a-home-lab-for-offensive-security-basics.html)?
  I've been playing around in mine quite a bit in the evenings and weekends
  while working from home.  My Windows domain skills have atrophied quite a bit,
  and I'm trying to reconcile that.  Hopefuilly I'll succeed.  :)
* Get in some reading time.  eBooks require no shipping, so instant
  gratification.  I can recommend almost anything from [No Starch
  Press](https://nostarch.com/).  At the moment, I'm looking at [Black Hat
  Go](https://amzn.to/34k03xu), and just recently read [Real-World Bug
  Hunting](https://amzn.to/2xWJeg3).
* [**SANS**](https://sans.org) continues to offer their online trainings.
  Additionally, they've launched a bunch of [virtual CTF
  challenges](https://www.sans.org/blog/and-now-for-something-awesome-sans-launches-new-series-of-worldwide-capture-the-flag-cyber-events/), including
  many free opportunities.  I played in the Virtual Mini-NetWars Mission 1, and
  it was a lot of fun and the content was absolutely great.  It was like playing
  a hacking RPG.
* [**Offensive Security**](https://www.offensive-security.com/) has their online
  trainings as per usual.  This includes both the very well-known
  Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (OSCP), as well as Cracking the Perimeter
  (OSCE), and Advanded Web Attacks and Exploitation (OSWE).  I've done both OSCP
  and OSCE in the past, and can highly recommend both of them.
* Check out a CTF on [**CTFTime**](https://ctftime.org).

No matter what you end up doing, make sure you take some time from yourself and
disconnect from all the bad news.  It's so easy to become overwhelmed with
everything going on.  Focus on something you can control and reaching your
goals.
