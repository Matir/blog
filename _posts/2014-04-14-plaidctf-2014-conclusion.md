The 2014 edition of PlaidCTF was excellent, but I wish we'd been able to make it through more challenges.  We cleared about 7 challenges, but really only two of them felt worth writing up.  The others have been well documented elsewhere, no sense in rewriting the same thing.

I liked how the challenges often required a series of exploits/techniques, this is much like what happens in the real world.  I do wish I had spent more time on binary exploitation, attempting to get a solution to <code>__nightmares_\_</code> burned a lot of time.

Plaid's [website post-mortem](http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/?p=1203) is also a good read, interesting to see the things involved in running a CTF.
