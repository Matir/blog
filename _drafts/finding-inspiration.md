I've been having a lot of trouble lately, feeling like I'm not doing the things
I need to do to move towards my personal goals or ensure that I continue to do
interesting work.  As one of several things I'm trying to do, I'm trying to
catalog things that have inspired me recently, or whose work I aspire to imitate.
This is a no-particular-order list of classes, presentations, videos, papers,
and other that remind me why I love working in Information Security, in hopes
that it will help me find my mojo and enthusiasm for what I do again.
