For those unfamiliar with the term, Hacker Summer Camp is the combination of DEF
CON, Black Hat USA, and BSides Las Vegas that takes place in the hot Las Vegas
sun every summer, along with all the associated parties and side events.  It's
the largest gathering of information security professionals and enthusiasts, and
has been growing for 25 years.  In this post, I'll present my views on how to
get the most out of your 2018 trip to the desert, along with tips & points from
some of my friends.

## The Panel ##

Because not everyone enjoys everything the same way, I've asked a few of my
friends to chime in for this blog post as well.  Some are new to the field, and
others have been around a lot longer than myself.  These are **itsc0rg1**,
**illusorycake**, **dissect0r**, **fadec0d3**, and **Anonymous**.

## The Events ##

There are 3 main events: DEF CON, Black Hat, and BSides Las Vegas (BSides LV).
Along with this, there are dozens of parties (corporate sponsors, DEF CON local
groups, etc.) and a number of smaller events like QueerCon and the Diana
Initiative.

### DEF CON ###

**DEF CON** is the largest and original of the 3 conferences.  Founded in 1993,
it is one of the longest running Hacker/Computer Security conferences, drawing
an estimated 25,000 attendees for DEF CON 25 in 2017.  It's widely speculated
that this year's attendance will hit 30,000, so be ready to meet some new
friends.  Introverts and those whose dislike crowds will want to make sure to be
prepared to take breaks from the masses at DEF CON.

In case you missed the big announcement, DEF CON will be spread across two
hotels this year: Caesar's Palace and the Flamingo.  I'm excited about this
change, but it does mean more time out in the Las Vegas sun.  This seems to be
due to the continued growth of the DEF CON "Village" concept, which is very
exciting to me -- it gives more space for the niche interests within the hacker
subculture to come together and explore their specific topics in more depth.

DEF CON has earned the nickname "line con" among some attendees, as it seems
like there's a line for everything.  Want to attend a talk?  Line up an hour
before.  Want to get into a village when it opens?  Better be lined up.  Want to
get your badge early on Thursday?  Try lining up at 1AM.  That being said, you
don't *have* to do things this way.  The talks will end up on YouTube (or buy
them even sooner) or you can always hang out in someone's hotel room and watch
them over the hotel cable.  Villages are generally accessible if you don't go
first thing.

DEF CON is the most "hacker culture" of the conferences -- lots of hackers, very
casual, no corporate sponsors.  (This also means no free swag, so you might want
to check out Black Hat if you're looking for the free stuff.)  DEF CON does have
a fairly decent vendor floor -- note that these are not vendors of security
snake oil, but vendors of cool hacker stuff to sell right there at the
conference.  (Including a *lot* of hacker shirts.)

### Black Hat Briefings ###

Black Hat involves both the "Briefings" (talks) and the "Trainings."  Black Hat
trainings are generally very high quality, and the ticket price shows it.  The
briefings are also high quality, but will also eventually end up on YouTube.  As
a general rule, those attending either briefings or trainings are getting their
pass paid for by their employer or self-employed and able to deduct the expense.

Here you'll find far more attendees in polos or button-up shirts and khakis than in
the black t-shirt and jeans of DEF CON.  You'll also find the occasional suit,
which I really don't understand in the Las Vegas heat.

Black Hat has a much larger vendor area than DEF CON, but in this case, I *do*
mean vendors to sell you security snake oil.  Every IDS, endpoint security
solution, consultancy, and magic appliance vendor will be there.  Some of them
will have free things for you.  Some of them will not.  Such is life.

### BSides Las Vegas ###

BSides Las Vegas is a smaller conference (just a few hundred people) and runs
more or less in parallel to Black Hat Briefings.  BSidesLV was the first BSides
security conference, intended to be the "B-Side" to Black Hat.  It's a great
option for those looking for more of a community feel or not wanting to pay for
a Black Hat pass.

BSides is small, but still has a lot of high-quality talks.  Many of them will
also be presented at one of the other conferences, but will give you a chance to
be up close with the speakers.

BSides is also home to my favorite educational CTF: [Pros vs
Joes](http://prosversusjoes.net/).  It's a great CTF designed to give players
hands on experience with a variety of tools and techniques, and provide an
opportunity to do things they might not have done before.

### Ask the Panel: DEF CON, BSides Las Vegas, Black Hat: pick one.  Why? ###

**Matir**: Hands down DEF CON.  It's one of the few opportunities I get where I
feel comfortable being myself and even talking to strangers.  There's a sense of
belonging with many of the other attendees, and it's amazing how passionate
everyone is about what they're working on.  Of the three, it's the one I feel
most embodies the hacker spirit and culture.

**fadec0d3**: Both DEF CON and BSides for the culture.

**illusorycake**: BSides Las Vegas because it seems easier to get into the
interactional aspects of it due to the smaller crowd. DEF CON is a hell of a fun
experience but it seems a bit more difficult to understand what all is there to
interact with. I stumbled upon really neat stuff both years I've been to DEF CON
though, so if you can swing both BSides and DEF CON, I'd recommend it. I've been
to Black Hat once and didn't really feel compelled to go again.

**itsc0rg1**: Defcon, I love the villages and the interactions.

**dissect0r**: I think they all have their pros and cons, and I know many folks
that like to do more than one every year.  Based on work schedules, etc., I tend
to always shoot for DEF CON, but I should mention that I like DEF CON more for
catching up with friends and colleagues than solely for the content of the
conference talks/tracks.  I also think that DEF CON has more variety overall
when it comes to topics, vendors, events, and personalities.

**Anonymous**: DEF CON. Black Hat is too corporate (and pricey) for my tastes,
and while BSidesLV can be fun due to its size, DEF CON is just something that
everyone should experience, imo. It can be huge and overwhelming but also small
and fun.
