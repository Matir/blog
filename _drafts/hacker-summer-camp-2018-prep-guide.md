For those unfamiliar with the term, Hacker Summer Camp is the combination of DEF
CON, Black Hat USA, and BSides Las Vegas that takes place in the hot Las Vegas
sun every summer, along with all the associated parties and side events.  It's
the largest gathering of hackers, information security professionals and
enthusiasts, and has been growing for 25 years.  In this post, I'll present my
views on how to get the most out of your 2018 trip to the desert, along with
tips & points from some of my friends.

## The Panel ##

Because not everyone enjoys everything the same way, I've asked a few of my
friends to chime in for this blog post as well.  Some are new to the field, and
others have been around a lot longer than myself.  These are **itsc0rg1**,
**illusorycake**, **dissect0r**, **fadec0d3**, and **Anonymous**.

## The Events ##

There are 3 main events: [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org), [Black
Hat](https://www.blackhat.com), and [BSides Las
Vegas](https://www.bsideslv.org/) (BSides LV).  Along with this, there are
dozens of parties (corporate sponsors, DEF CON local groups, etc.) and a number
of smaller events like [QueerCon](https://www.queercon.org) and the [Diana
Initiative](https://www.dianainitiative.org/).

### DEF CON ###

[**DEF CON**](https://www.defcon.org) is the largest and original of the 3
conferences.  Founded in 1993, it is one of the longest running Hacker/Computer
Security conferences, drawing an estimated 25,000 attendees for DEF CON 25 in
2017.  It's widely speculated that this year's attendance will hit 30,000, so be
ready to meet some new friends.  Introverts and those whose dislike
crowds will want to make sure to be prepared to take breaks from the
masses at DEF CON.

In case you missed the big announcement, DEF CON will be spread across two
hotels this year: Caesar's Palace and the Flamingo.  I'm excited about this
change, but it does mean more time out in the Las Vegas sun.  This seems to be
due to the continued growth of the DEF CON "Village" concept, which is very
exciting to me -- it gives more space for the niche interests within the hacker
subculture to come together and explore their specific topics in more depth.

DEF CON has earned the nickname "line con" among some attendees, as it seems
like there's a line for everything.  Want to attend a talk?  Line up an hour
before.  Want to get into a village when it opens?  Better be lined up.  Want to
get your badge early on Thursday?  Try lining up at 1AM.  That being said, you
don't *have* to do things this way.  The talks will end up on YouTube (or buy
them even sooner) or you can always hang out in someone's hotel room and watch
them over the hotel cable.  Villages are generally accessible if you don't go
first thing.

DEF CON is the most "hacker culture" of the conferences -- lots of hackers, very
casual, no corporate sponsors.  (This also means no free swag, so you might want
to check out Black Hat if you're looking for the free stuff.)  DEF CON does have
a fairly decent vendor floor -- note that these are not vendors of security
snake oil, but vendors of cool hacker stuff to sell right there at the
conference.  (Including a *lot* of hacker shirts.)

### Black Hat Briefings ###

Black Hat involves both the "Briefings" (talks) and the "Trainings."  Black Hat
trainings are generally very high quality, and the ticket price shows it.  The
briefings are also high quality, but will also eventually end up on YouTube.  As
a general rule, those attending either briefings or trainings are getting their
pass paid for by their employer or self-employed and able to deduct the expense.

Here you'll find far more attendees in polos or button-up shirts and khakis than in
the black t-shirt and jeans of DEF CON.  You'll also find the occasional suit,
which I really don't understand in the Las Vegas heat.

Black Hat has a much larger vendor area than DEF CON, but in this case, I *do*
mean vendors to sell you security snake oil.  Every IDS, endpoint security
solution, consultancy, and magic appliance vendor will be there.  Some of them
will have free things for you.  Some of them will not.  Such is life.

### BSides Las Vegas ###

BSides Las Vegas is a smaller conference (just a few hundred people) and runs
more or less in parallel to Black Hat Briefings.  BSidesLV was the first BSides
security conference, intended to be the "B-Side" to Black Hat.  It's a great
option for those looking for more of a community feel or not wanting to pay for
a Black Hat pass.

BSides is small, but still has a lot of high-quality talks.  Many of them will
also be presented at one of the other conferences, but will give you a chance to
be up close with the speakers.

BSides is also home to my favorite educational CTF: [Pros vs
Joes](http://prosversusjoes.net/).  It's a great CTF designed to give players
hands on experience with a variety of tools and techniques, and provide an
opportunity to do things they might not have done before.

### Ask the Panel: DEF CON, BSides Las Vegas, Black Hat: pick one.  Why? ###

**Matir**: Hands down DEF CON.  It's one of the few opportunities I get where I
feel comfortable being myself and even talking to strangers.  There's a sense of
belonging with many of the other attendees, and it's amazing how passionate
everyone is about what they're working on.  Of the three, it's the one I feel
most embodies the hacker spirit and culture.

**fadec0d3**: Both DEF CON and BSides for the culture.

**illusorycake**: BSides Las Vegas because it seems easier to get into the
interactional aspects of it due to the smaller crowd. DEF CON is a hell of a fun
experience but it seems a bit more difficult to understand what all is there to
interact with. I stumbled upon really neat stuff both years I've been to DEF CON
though, so if you can swing both BSides and DEF CON, I'd recommend it. I've been
to Black Hat once and didn't really feel compelled to go again.

**itsc0rg1**: Defcon, I love the villages and the interactions.

**dissect0r**: I think they all have their pros and cons, and I know many folks
that like to do more than one every year.  Based on work schedules, etc., I tend
to always shoot for DEF CON, but I should mention that I like DEF CON more for
catching up with friends and colleagues than solely for the content of the
conference talks/tracks.  I also think that DEF CON has more variety overall
when it comes to topics, vendors, events, and personalities.

**Anonymous**: DEF CON. Black Hat is too corporate (and pricey) for my tastes,
and while BSidesLV can be fun due to its size, DEF CON is just something that
everyone should experience, imo. It can be huge and overwhelming but also small
and fun.

## Travel Logistics ##

If you haven't already booked your hotel and airfare, there's no time like the
present.  Rooms at Caesar's Palace have dramatically increased in price.  The
other properties in the area still have decent availability.  If you don't want
to pay Caesar's pricing, Flamingo is a good choice for convenience (since the
conference is spreading over there).  Alternatively, the rooms at Paris are
quite nice, it gets you some distance from the crowds, but is still just across
the street.  (Though if you've never been to Vegas before, note that "across the
street" is still likely a 15-20 minute walk from your room to the conference
floor.)

I've had numerous debates with others about whether or not to stay at the
conference hotel.  (Caesar's for DEF CON, Mandalay Bay for Black Hat, or Tuscany
for BSidesLV.)  I maintain that I like to be able to just drop off stuff I don't
want to carry around, take a short break at times, etc.  Others feel that
getting more distance between themselves and the conferences is superior.  At
the end of the day, it comes down to personal preference (and potentially cost,
depending on the hotels you're comparing).

Airfare is already going up as well.  Whether or not it will keep going up is a
mystery (I don't think anyone really understands airfare pricing, even the
airlines) but it's probably worth booking now.  One of the nice things about Las
Vegas is the number of direct flights to get there.

I like to arrive the afternoon before the first thing I'm attending, and depart
the morning after the last.  While that does add to the hotel stay and the
amount of time I'm spending in Las Vegas, arriving the afternoon before allows
me to get settled in and be ready to go in the morning, and staying until the
morning after ensures I don't have to leave early for my flight.  Additionally,
I've found it's a great chance to have a post-con dinner or drinks with new
connections (or ones I don't get to see often enough).

## What to Do ##

The most ubiquituous piece of advice you'll find about attending DEF CON is to
be an active participant and not just sit there and hope to have things happen
by osmosis.  You absolutely can go and just sit in the talks and listen.  I did
mostly that at my first DEF CON, and it was good -- but it wasn't great.
**Participating** makes it great.

So what do I mean by participating?  It can come in many forms:

- Go to villages and try hands on activities (soldering, lockpicking, etc.)
- Meet people and find out what they're working on
- Find a group to try one of the contests (Scavenger Hunt, Badge Challenge,
  etc.)

At DEF CON, in addition to the talks, you have a large number of other
activities, so nobody can say there's nothing they want to do.  In fact, I never
manage to get to all the things I wanted to.

- Many Villages
  - Packet Hacking
  - Lockpicking
  - Tamper Evident
  - Crypto and Privacy
  - Wireless
  - IoT
  - Car Hacking
  - Election Hacking
  - + More every year (and some I'm sure I've forgotten)
- Vendors willing to take your money
- Contests
  - Scavenger Hunt
  - Capture the Packet
  - Badge Challenge
  - Beverage Cooling Contraption
  - Hack Fortress
- Side Events
  - DEF CON Shoot
  - Toxic BBQ
  - Drinking (who knew?)
  - Networking
  - Parties (Official & Unofficial)

I put a big emphasis on the hands on activities.  I have seen people demo new
tools (DEF CON demo labs), taught kids how to hack (R00tz Asylum), first learned
to pick locks (Lockpicking Village), learned about network forensics (Capture
the Packet), seen people hack cars (Car Hacking Village) and hacked on IoT
devices and voting machines (IoT and Election Hacking villages).  I meet up with
people I only see once a year and share what we're both working on, meet friends
of friends, and so much more.  Every year I spend every waking moment doing
stuff and still wish I'd had more time at the end.

### What not to do! ###

Look, it's pretty simple: don't be a dumbass.  Please don't ruin things for
others.  (It sometimes amazes me DEF CON doesn't get banned from hotels, but I
guess for enough money, the hotels will tolerate quite a bit.)  Examples of
things you should not do:

- Get alcohol poisioning and spend your con in the hospital.
- Do grossly illegal things (Vegas has cameras, or so I hear)
- Brag about hacks that were a crime (true or not) unless you *want* to chat
  with the feds.
- Harass or assault anyone.

Also, please try not to argue with the DEF CON Goons or the BSidesLV Staff.
Most of the time, you'll like stupid, and they usually have a good reason for
what they're asking you to do.  (Crowd control, fire code, etc.)

### Ask the Panel: What's your favorite thing about Hacker Summer Camp? ###

What's your favorite thing about Hacker Summer Camp? What can you not miss or
just must do?

**Matir**: The IoT village is one of my favorite places to hang out and meet
people with similar interests.  I'm also on staff for the Pros vs Joes CTF at
BSides Las Vegas, so you'll find me there during BSidesLV.  I'll also always
make the Dual Core performance at DEF CON, and sometimes some of int0x80's side
performances at other events. (I don't deny it, I'm a bit of a fanboy.)

**fadec0d3**: Don’t miss the workshops & villages.

**itsc0rg1**: Conversations / Contests.

**dissect0r**: I try to swing past *every* hacker village at least once, but
usually several times.  Sometimes there are unique and interesting things going
on or fun people participating in the village when you least expect it.  And I
always bring a lot of cash for the vendor area — every year there seems to be a
handful of devices that everyone wants, and sometimes stock clears out fast!  I
always throw down a lot of money on hardware and new gadgets or tools.

**Anonymous**: My favorite part is learning new things. I try to challenge
myself as much as possible to learn something new every year, whether it's
soldering (DEF CON XX), a new attack technique, or starting a new programming
language. In many cases it's not something I use again, but I can at least say
I've tried it. I absolutely can't miss the Dual Core performance.

## What to Bring ##

What you should or should not bring with you is also a surprisingly divisive
topic.  I'll begin by admitting that I'm a bit of a pack rat and tend to bring
everything I could possibly want to have with me.  (Ok, maybe not quite that
bad, but I still tend to bring far more than necessary.)  Others prefer a much
more minimalist approach.  Both probably work out well for different
individuals.  (Or maybe I'm quite unreasonable about what I bring.)

### Electronics ###

The DEF CON network is often described as "the most dangerous network in the
world".  While I think this overstates the risks (by quite a bit, actually), it
makes sense to take precautions and to consider the network a hostile network.
(Though you really should think of any network you don't control as a hostile
network.)

Some will suggest that you leave all your electronics at home (or at least in
your room) and spend your time doing things that require your in-person presence
(meeting people, hands-on activities, etc.).  This is not a bad idea, but I
think almost everyone will end up carrying at least a cell phone with them, even if
only to stay in touch with friends.

When it comes to laptops, there are two questions to be answered: will you bring
one with you at all, and if so, will you carry it with you daily?

I think most will end up bringing a laptop.  Some might feel comfortable
bringing their everyday laptop, and I've done that before (after swapping out
the SSD for one with an alternate image to protect my data, just in case).  This
year, however, I'll be carrying a Chromebook -- the [Asus
C302CA](https://amzn.to/2IJs3Tq) with
[Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) installed.  If all you need is
internet access, a Chromebook offers the highest level of security while on a
hostile network.  Placing it in developer mode does reduce the security
guarantees somewhat, but also allows you to run Crouton, which gives a more or
less fully functional Debian Linux chroot.  You can also run Debian derivatives
like Kali, which is what I do, since I will use the device for CTFs and
contests.

If you're not going to participate in a contest or activity that requires the
use of a laptop, I encourage you to leave it in your hotel room safe.  (Yes, I
acknowledge that carrying it with you is a better mitigation against evil maid
attacks, but if you're that paranoid, you're probably already aware of that.)
There's no sense in carrying extra weight and hopefully you'll be spending your
time doing interactive things instead of staring at a laptop screen.

Once you've decided what you'll bring, you should take some reasonable steps to
secure your electronics.

On all devices, you should setup a VPN service (either commercial or your own)
and use it at all times.  I've used [Private Internet
Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com) when travelling, but there are a
number of providers with good reputations out there.  I even use it over the
cellular network because of the rumors of Stingrays and Rogue Cell Towers.
(Yes, if the operator of those devices has an 0-day for your baseband, you're
still screwed.)  You should also ensure that all devices are using a password
for login and lock after going to screensaver/sleep mode.

If you connect to the conference WiFi, connect to the "secure" DEF CON network
that uses 802.1x authentication.  If you've setup the proper certificate, this
should make it very difficult for someone to create a rogue AP.  This network
also does not allow client-to-client traffic, so should be reasonably secure
against too much malicious activity.  You'll still want to use the VPN though.

For cell phones, use a phone with the latest Android or iOS build, or bring a
burner phone (i.e., one with no data that you care about).  Make sure it's fully
patched before you leave home, and don't accept updates that may appear while at
con.  Enable device encryption and at least a strong PIN (if not password) to
unlock the screen.  It is exceedingly unlikely that someone will waste an iOS or
Android 0-day to pop random phones while at the conference.

For laptops, the advice is similar.  You should be fully patched and enable
full-disk encryption.  Turn on a software firewall, dropping all incoming
connections.  Set a BIOS/UEFI administrator password.  When it's not in your
posession, at least put it in your room safe.  (This is more about theft than
about hacking, but it's a good idea either way.)

### Cash ###

While Black Hat is probably not a problem with only a credit card, DEF CON is
certainly a predominantly cash economy.  DEF CON badge purchase is cash only, no
preregistration, the official DEF CON SWAG area is cash only, and all of the
bars at the events are cash only.  Most of the vendors will deal mostly in cash
(some exclusively) and, of course, Las Vegas as a city still sees a ton of cash
flowing through.  (Please remember to tip!)

Put simply, you'll want to bring cash with you.  At an absolute minimum, DEF CON
badges are $280 this year.  Things can quickly add up though if you get swag,
buy gadgets, drink a lot, etc.  Obviously, it's better to bring too much cash
than too little, as using the ATMs on the casino floor will, at a minimum, carry
a hefty fee.  At worst, the ATM may be compromised or have a skimmer on it.
(Again, this may be a case where DEF CON's bark is worst than its bite, but it's
still a good idea to be safe.)

### Food and Drink ###

You'll want to eat and drink.  Drinking alcohol is optional, but pretty common
as well.  There's a wide range of strategies on how to do this depending upon
your budget and personal tastes/desires.  Attendees on a tight budget can bring
a lot with them (energy bars, etc.) or get food at a local grocery store, but
Vegas is also home to a number of high quality restaurants, including some that
are a great value.

For quick/cheap eats, there's a number of options:

1. Close by, both Caesars and Bally's have food courts with a variety of typical
   food court fare.
2. [Shake Shack](https://www.shakeshack.com/location/las-vegas-nv/) down the
   strip at New York New York is very popular.
3. Fremont Street, just a little off the strip, has a number of good
   budget-friendly options.

Las Vegas buffets can be a good *value*, but they are often not *cheap* -- you
can get a lot for your money, but it's still quite a bit more than the cheaper
venues.  On the other hand, buffets can be good for a group because of the sheer
variety of food available.  The [buffet at Caesar's
(Bacchanal)](https://www.caesars.com/caesars-palace/restaurants/bacchanal-buffet#.WwXyg3XwZFQ)
is very good, but also fairly expensive -- around $50/person for dinner!

At the upper end, Vegas is home to a number of Michelin Star and celebrity chef
restaurants.  You can find something to suit any taste.  I once had a coworker
suggest a restaurant to me with a several-hundred dollar tasting menu.  (I'm
sure it's great, but I doubt I have the palette to appreciate it.)

While convenient, I'd skip the food lines setup in a number of the rooms at DEF
CON and Black Hat.  These provide low-quality food at very high prices.  (Think
vastly overpriced sandwiches and hot dogs.)

Regardless of how you choose to eat, you must stay hydrated.  Las Vegas is both
hot and dry, which makes for quick dehydration.  Even being inside you may find
yourself less hydrated than usual due to the dry air.  Bottled water can be
expensive, especially if you buy it from the hotel, so many choose to either
[have some delivered](https://amzn.to/2x6697w) or refill a
[Camelbak](https://amzn.to/2kibsrc) or [Sigg-style water
bottle](https://amzn.to/2GK4QLh).  I've let myself get dehydrated a few times
during Hacker Summer Camp, and it really ruins things.  Even once you start
drinking properly, it will be a day or two before you start feeling right again.
In a 4 day event, that's a long time to feel like crap.

Speaking of drinking: a **lot** of drinking goes on at DEF CON, BSidesLV, and the
associated parties.  I've found a good way to help avoid a hangover is one
drink (cup/glass/bottle) of water to each alcoholic drink I go through.  I'm not
sure if it slows my intake of alcohol or just keeps me more hydrated to avoid
the hangover, but it does work.

If you're drinking on a budget, try to get yourself invited to sponsored
parties/events with open bars.  I've also heard some people carry flasks, but I
don't know how well that works out.  The bars setup within the con space are
going to serve mainstream drinks for hotel prices (think $6 for Bud Light and $8
for house/well liquor).  If you're at BSidesLV or want to travel over to
Tuscany, [Pub 365](https://www.tuscanylv.com/restaurant/pub-365/) has a great
selection (365 beers!) and is pretty reasonably priced, with many craft beers
for $5-6 each.  The food at Pub 365 is solid as well.

My personal favorite food and drink venues in Vegas:

- [Pub 365](https://www.tuscanylv.com/restaurant/pub-365/) at Tuscany for the
  Craft Beer selection, solid food, and decent atmosphere.  Busy during
  BSidesLV, quiet the rest of the week.
- [Gordon Ramsay Pub &
  Grill](https://www.caesars.com/caesars-palace/restaurants/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill)
  at Caesar's Palace has good service and excellent food.  A little overpriced
  to go with the celebrity name, but not over the top.
- [The Buffet at
  Wynn](http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/Dining/CasualDining/TheBuffet) for a buffet
  and a break from the conference hotels.  On the expensive end for buffets, but
  the food is absolutely top notch and the pastries in the dessert section are
  the best.
- [Shake Shack](https://www.shakeshack.com/location/las-vegas-nv/) is one of my
  wife's favorites, and she introduced me to it last year.  Solid burger, great
  shakes, and quick to boot.  The burger here was better than Gordon Ramsay
  Burger at Planet Hollywood.
- [Carnegie
  Deli](https://www.mirage.com/en/restaurants/carnegie-delicatessen.html) at the
  Mirage has solid deli-style food.  The sandwiches are expensive for a
  sandwich, but big enough to split or to have for two meals.  Seriously.  (Even
  for a big guy like me!)

### Other Supplies ###

Clothing should be pretty obvious, and you can count on August in Las Vegas
being hot.  Depending on which events you are attending, the social conventions
of dress code may vary somewhat.  For example, at both BSidesLV and DEF CON, the
"norm" is a t-shirt and shorts or jeans.  Black Hat will be a mix of t-shirts
and polos with jeans or khakis.  (And yes, some button-down shirts and suits
too.)  Of the three, Black Hat probably has the most information communicated by
what someone is wearing.  You can usually spot upper management, middle
management, and engineers on sight.

If you're planning to go to parties held at any of the Vegas clubs, you'll
probably need to plan for their dress codes.  Most of the clubs will enforce
their code after a certain time, and at a minimum men will want nice jeans (not
torn/ripped and no shorts) and a collared shirt.  I won't begin to pretend to
know enough about women's fashion to say anything there, but just understand the
clubs will be enforcing dress codes in the evenings.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are also pool parties at BSidesLV and
Queercon.  If you want to attend these, you should probably bring a swimsuit.
Or, you know, shorts you don't mind getting wet.

You should also bring some aspirin or ibuprofen ("Advil" or "Motrin"), I don't
suggest paracetamol ("Tylenol") because you'll probably be drinking a bit, and
your liver won't like the combination.  (Note: I'm not a doctor and this isn't
medical advice, but you should probably keep that in mind.)

As to everyday carry, we've already covered the cell phone everyone will be
carrying, and the water bottle everyone *should* be carrying.  I also suggest
carrying a backup USB battery (even a small one) for your phone, your cash, and
hotel keycard.  Some also like notebooks or other ways to take notes during
talks or when meeting people.

### Ask the Panel: What do you carry with you at the cons? ###

**Matir**: Entirely too much.  I carry a cell phone, my
[Skeletool](https://amzn.to/2LpKlHf), cash, an [Anker
Powercore](https://amzn.to/2kk4ouj) battery, hotel room key, a small [Moleskine
notebook](https://amzn.to/2LoKI4U), business cards, and a [steel-barreled
pen](https://amzn.to/2LkT8KB).  I carry it all in a Timbuk2 backpack
specifically chosen to not be too big -- it forces me to make decisions about
what I carry, and prevents me from just taking everything with me.  This year
I'll be adding an [aluminum water bottle](https://amzn.to/2LsstLV) to stay
hydrated.

**illusorycake**: A laptop with my favorite Linux distro on it, water(s),
relevant power cords, a notebook or two, a few pens, chapstick, ibuprofen, cash,
ID, and all the swag I can find and fit in whatever bag I have with me. If
you're looking for a new t-shirt wardrobe, you can easily obtain it at Hacker
Summer Camp. One addition I'll be making to my bag this year is a portable
soldering iron so I can solder in a peaceful place and at my own pace.

**fadec0d3**: Bring a (lightweight) burner laptop you’re comfortable with using.

**itsC0rg1**: Deodorant, a water bottle and protein bars.

**dissect0r**: Backpack with the necessities (laptop, chargers, lock picks,
etc.), extra cash, snacks, hydration.

**Anonymous**: A backpack of some sort. (I'm not picky which one.) A portable
computer I can wipe. (Specifically a Lenovo 11e with an upgraded SSD running
Kali Linux.) A small soldering kit.  A kit of electronics tools.  My con phone
(not so much a burner as simply a phone, like the aforementioned laptop, that I
can easily wipe once home).  In the hotel room, I might also have things like
more electronics parts, etc. mainly in anticipation of a contest or badge that I
can play around with.

## First Timers ##

If this happens to be your first Hacker Summer Camp, it's pretty easy to be
overwhelmed by it all.  Actually, even if it's *not* your first time, it's
pretty easy to be overwhelmed by it all.

### 3-2-1 Rule ###

If you attend the DEF CON 101 session, you'll hear about the 3-2-1 rule, but I
think it's so important, that it bears repeating here.  At an absolute minimum,
you should get **3 hours of sleep, 2 meals, and 1 shower each day**.  This rule
is both for your own safety and the comfort of others.  (I wonder if they should
add a "4" for "4 liters of water".)

On behalf of fellow attendees, the shower is the most important part of that
rule.  Because of the heat and the walking, I will tend to end up taking 2
showers every day: one in the morning to wake me up, and one just before dinner,
because I don't want to smell at dinner.  One of my friends said she was going
to bring travel sized deodorants for other attendees, and she wasn't kidding.
Please don't be that person.  (In case you're unaware, "body sprays" like Axe
are *not* a deodorant.  Then you just smell like sweat and cheap body spray.)

### Manage Your Energy ###

I've definitely [mentioned this
before](/2016/02/18/hacker-summer-camp-planning-guide.html), but it bears
repeating.  Even if you're only going to a single con of the week, it's a long
event with long days, and it's in a hot climate.  If you try to do everything,
you'll just end up feeling like crap or burning yourself out.  Manage your
energy as you go, and if you need to take a break, take it!  I know FOMO (fear
of missing out) is a thing, but if you burn yourself out too far, you'll miss
out on a lot more than a short break.

Taking a break also doesn't mean you have to completely stop doing anything con
related.  There are some ways to recover your energy while still having a good
time and doing things:

- Grab a (new) friend and head to one of the quieter bars for a drink and to
  catch up.
- If you're staying onsite or at one of the other Caesar's properties with the
  talks on TV, head to your room and watch a talk.
- If you know someone from one of the groups that has a suite, head up there to
  hang out.  They tend to be a *lot* quieter and more chill than the con floor.
- If you or someone you know has brought electronic gear with them, find a quiet
  place to work on the electronic badge (or
  [#badgelife](https://twitter.com/hashtag/badgelife?lang=en)).

You should also be prepared to walk a *lot*.  I know, a lot of us hackers are
far more used to sitting in front of the comforting glow of a few LCDs, but even
within the hotels, you'll be walking a lot between areas.  So wear comfortable
shoes and be ready for the hot Vegas sun to make you sweat, a lot.

### Plan Ahead ###

You should do some amount of planning ahead for con.  I failed miserably at this
my first time, and it could have been so much better if I hadn't.

I'm not saying you should make a minute-by-minute (or even hour-by-hour) plan.
But you should have an idea of what's available to do, what your top goals are,
and what is located where.

### Ask the Panel: What's one thing you wish you knew before your first DEF CON?  ###

**Matir**: I should have been ready to *do* more than just go to talks and
parties.  Being ready for competitions, being ready to be more social, having a
better plan.  If you don't know all the things that are going on, it's so easy
to become frozen and overwhelmed by it all.

**illusorycake**: I wish I had known the scope of DEF CON. There are lots of
different things going on: talks, villages, smaller conferences/events that
overlap DEF CON, etc. It can be overwhelming to even simply just know what is
available for you to do. I recommend talking to folks who have been before and
asking them questions about anything that's confusing once you have a
schedule/agenda in front of you to reference.

**fadec0d3**: Don’t worry about missing lectures, they’re recorded.  Don’t worry
about missing lectures, they’re recorded.

**itsC0rg1**: Taking breaks is important, crowds are a bit overwhelming.

**dissect0r**: I tell newcomers not to be too rigid about their scheduling
expectations, don’t expect to make it to every exciting talk you want to see.
Sometimes the lines are staggering, and standing room only is not always a fun
way learn new things.  I expect to catch some of those epic talks later online
or from the recordings.  Be flexible, don’t be afraid to break from your
expected schedule to grab a drink with some new friends, and definitely bring
some extra cash to blow on vendor wares!

**Anonymous**: That not sleeping is ok but you still need to sleep.

## Bonus Panel Question: What's your best Hacker Summer Camp memory? ##

**Matir**: Dual Core performing at The Summit (an [EFF](https://www.eff.org)
fundraiser party) at DEF CON 20.  It was an incredible show, and I really got
into it, plus the party had great people and great drinks.  There are so many
runners up: hanging out with one of my best friends until early in the morning,
a 2nd place finish in Capture the Packet, and getting a bright red mohawk for
mohawkcon.

**illusorycake**: Pros vs Joes at BSides Las Vegas. If you're looking for a
practical experience of what it's like to be a security engineer, this is the
CTF for you.

**fadec0d3**: Accidentally overloading the electronic badge which broadcast to
the radio, and ripping apart someone’s phone in the name of science to pick up
IR visually for the electronic badge challenge.

**itsC0rg1**: A Goon handing me a bunch of free stickers when I was nearly
collapsed from exhaustion.

**dissect0r**: There are a bunch, I don’t want to limit myself to just one.
Some of my fondest memories are: meeting heroes in the security space — this
brings a sense of realism to meet some of these people you admire online.
Catching up with good friends that you don’t see near often enough.  And
learning new tricks and hacks that you didn’t know before.

**Anonymous**: Hanging out late at night working on some random contest. DEF CON
can be such a nice blend of social and hacking, which is something we don't
always get to do if we don't have access to a hackerspace and spend most of our
time at home working on things. I've hatched so many plans and schemes and
learned so much just sitting in the con area chatting late at night.

## Summary ##

I hope this has been at least a little bit useful to you, or at least a good
reminder of good times at Hacker Summer Camp.  Feel free to share or hit me up
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matir) if you have ideas or suggestions for
things I should have covered.

I suggest also checking out the [Defcon for
N00bs](https://github.com/hacking-and-coffee/defcon-for-n00bs) guide for other
advice and another take on preparing for con.

Finally, a big thanks to illusorycake, fadec0d3, itsC0rg1, dissect0r, and
Anonymous for contributing their thoughts.  You all are great friends and
hackers.  I owe each of you a drink (or several) at Hacker Summer Camp this
year.
