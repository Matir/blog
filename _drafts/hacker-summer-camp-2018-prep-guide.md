For those unfamiliar with the term, Hacker Summer Camp is the combination of DEF
CON, Black Hat USA, and BSides Las Vegas that takes place in the hot Las Vegas
sun every summer, along with all the associated parties and side events.  It's
the largest gathering of hackers, information security professionals and
enthusiasts, and has been growing for 25 years.  In this post, I'll present my
views on how to get the most out of your 2018 trip to the desert, along with
tips & points from some of my friends.

## The Panel ##

Because not everyone enjoys everything the same way, I've asked a few of my
friends to chime in for this blog post as well.  Some are new to the field, and
others have been around a lot longer than myself.  These are **itsc0rg1**,
**illusorycake**, **dissect0r**, **fadec0d3**, and **Anonymous**.

## The Events ##

There are 3 main events: DEF CON, Black Hat, and BSides Las Vegas (BSides LV).
Along with this, there are dozens of parties (corporate sponsors, DEF CON local
groups, etc.) and a number of smaller events like QueerCon and the Diana
Initiative.

### DEF CON ###

**DEF CON** is the largest and original of the 3 conferences.  Founded in 1993,
it is one of the longest running Hacker/Computer Security conferences, drawing
an estimated 25,000 attendees for DEF CON 25 in 2017.  It's widely speculated
that this year's attendance will hit 30,000, so be ready to meet some new
friends.  Introverts and those whose dislike crowds will want to make sure to be
prepared to take breaks from the masses at DEF CON.

In case you missed the big announcement, DEF CON will be spread across two
hotels this year: Caesar's Palace and the Flamingo.  I'm excited about this
change, but it does mean more time out in the Las Vegas sun.  This seems to be
due to the continued growth of the DEF CON "Village" concept, which is very
exciting to me -- it gives more space for the niche interests within the hacker
subculture to come together and explore their specific topics in more depth.

DEF CON has earned the nickname "line con" among some attendees, as it seems
like there's a line for everything.  Want to attend a talk?  Line up an hour
before.  Want to get into a village when it opens?  Better be lined up.  Want to
get your badge early on Thursday?  Try lining up at 1AM.  That being said, you
don't *have* to do things this way.  The talks will end up on YouTube (or buy
them even sooner) or you can always hang out in someone's hotel room and watch
them over the hotel cable.  Villages are generally accessible if you don't go
first thing.

DEF CON is the most "hacker culture" of the conferences -- lots of hackers, very
casual, no corporate sponsors.  (This also means no free swag, so you might want
to check out Black Hat if you're looking for the free stuff.)  DEF CON does have
a fairly decent vendor floor -- note that these are not vendors of security
snake oil, but vendors of cool hacker stuff to sell right there at the
conference.  (Including a *lot* of hacker shirts.)

### Black Hat Briefings ###

Black Hat involves both the "Briefings" (talks) and the "Trainings."  Black Hat
trainings are generally very high quality, and the ticket price shows it.  The
briefings are also high quality, but will also eventually end up on YouTube.  As
a general rule, those attending either briefings or trainings are getting their
pass paid for by their employer or self-employed and able to deduct the expense.

Here you'll find far more attendees in polos or button-up shirts and khakis than in
the black t-shirt and jeans of DEF CON.  You'll also find the occasional suit,
which I really don't understand in the Las Vegas heat.

Black Hat has a much larger vendor area than DEF CON, but in this case, I *do*
mean vendors to sell you security snake oil.  Every IDS, endpoint security
solution, consultancy, and magic appliance vendor will be there.  Some of them
will have free things for you.  Some of them will not.  Such is life.

### BSides Las Vegas ###

BSides Las Vegas is a smaller conference (just a few hundred people) and runs
more or less in parallel to Black Hat Briefings.  BSidesLV was the first BSides
security conference, intended to be the "B-Side" to Black Hat.  It's a great
option for those looking for more of a community feel or not wanting to pay for
a Black Hat pass.

BSides is small, but still has a lot of high-quality talks.  Many of them will
also be presented at one of the other conferences, but will give you a chance to
be up close with the speakers.

BSides is also home to my favorite educational CTF: [Pros vs
Joes](http://prosversusjoes.net/).  It's a great CTF designed to give players
hands on experience with a variety of tools and techniques, and provide an
opportunity to do things they might not have done before.

### Ask the Panel: DEF CON, BSides Las Vegas, Black Hat: pick one.  Why? ###

**Matir**: Hands down DEF CON.  It's one of the few opportunities I get where I
feel comfortable being myself and even talking to strangers.  There's a sense of
belonging with many of the other attendees, and it's amazing how passionate
everyone is about what they're working on.  Of the three, it's the one I feel
most embodies the hacker spirit and culture.

**fadec0d3**: Both DEF CON and BSides for the culture.

**illusorycake**: BSides Las Vegas because it seems easier to get into the
interactional aspects of it due to the smaller crowd. DEF CON is a hell of a fun
experience but it seems a bit more difficult to understand what all is there to
interact with. I stumbled upon really neat stuff both years I've been to DEF CON
though, so if you can swing both BSides and DEF CON, I'd recommend it. I've been
to Black Hat once and didn't really feel compelled to go again.

**itsc0rg1**: Defcon, I love the villages and the interactions.

**dissect0r**: I think they all have their pros and cons, and I know many folks
that like to do more than one every year.  Based on work schedules, etc., I tend
to always shoot for DEF CON, but I should mention that I like DEF CON more for
catching up with friends and colleagues than solely for the content of the
conference talks/tracks.  I also think that DEF CON has more variety overall
when it comes to topics, vendors, events, and personalities.

**Anonymous**: DEF CON. Black Hat is too corporate (and pricey) for my tastes,
and while BSidesLV can be fun due to its size, DEF CON is just something that
everyone should experience, imo. It can be huge and overwhelming but also small
and fun.

## Travel Logistics ##

If you haven't already booked your hotel and airfare, there's no time like the
present.  Rooms at Caesar's Palace have dramatically increased in price.  The
other properties in the area still have decent availability.  If you don't want
to pay Caesar's pricing, Flamingo is a good choice for convenience (since the
conference is spreading over there).  Alternatively, the rooms at Paris are
quite nice, it gets you some distance from the crowds, but is still just across
the street.  (Though if you've never been to Vegas before, note that "across the
street" is still likely a 15-20 minute walk from your room to the conference
floor.)

I've had numerous debates with others about whether or not to stay at the
conference hotel.  (Caesar's for DEF CON, Mandalay Bay for Black Hat, or Tuscany
for BSidesLV.)  I maintain that I like to be able to just drop off stuff I don't
want to carry around, take a short break at times, etc.  Others feel that
getting more distance between themselves and the conferences is superior.  At
the end of the day, it comes down to personal preference (and potentially cost,
depending on the hotels you're comparing).

Airfare is already going up as well.  Whether or not it will keep going up is a
mystery (I don't think anyone really understands airfare pricing, even the
airlines) but it's probably worth booking now.  One of the nice things about Las
Vegas is the number of direct flights to get there.

I like to arrive the afternoon before the first thing I'm attending, and depart
the morning after the last.  While that does add to the hotel stay and the
amount of time I'm spending in Las Vegas, arriving the afternoon before allows
me to get settled in and be ready to go in the morning, and staying until the
morning after ensures I don't have to leave early for my flight.  Additionally,
I've found it's a great chance to have a post-con dinner or drinks with new
connections (or ones I don't get to see often enough).

## What to Do ##

The most ubiquituous piece of advice you'll find about attending DEF CON is to
be an active participant and not just sit there and hope to have things happen
by osmosis.  You absolutely can go and just sit in the talks and listen.  I did
mostly that at my first DEF CON, and it was good -- but it wasn't great.
**Participating** makes it great.

So what do I mean by participating?  It can come in many forms:

- Go to villages and try hands on activities (soldering, lockpicking, etc.)
- Meet people and find out what they're working on
- Find a group to try one of the contests (Scavenger Hunt, Badge Challenge,
  etc.)

At DEF CON, in addition to the talks, you have a large number of other
activities, so nobody can say there's nothing they want to do.  In fact, I never
manage to get to all the things I wanted to.

- Many Villages
  - Packet Hacking
  - Lockpicking
  - Tamper Evident
  - Crypto and Privacy
  - Wireless
  - IoT
  - Car Hacking
  - ...
- Vendors willing to take your money
- Contests
  - Scavenger Hunt
  - Capture the Packet
  - Badge Challenge
  - Beverage Cooling Contraption
  - Hack Fortress
- Side Events
  - DEF CON Shoot
  - Toxic BBQ
  - Drinking (who knew?)
  - Networking
  - Parties (Official & Unofficial)

### What not to do! ###

Look, it's pretty simple: don't be a dumbass.  Please don't ruin things for
others.  (It sometimes amazes me DEF CON doesn't get banned from hotels, but I
guess for enough money, the hotels will tolerate quite a bit.)  Examples of
things you should not do:

- Get alcohol poisioning and spend your con in the hospital.
- Do grossly illegal things (Vegas has cameras, or so I hear)
- Brag about hacks that were a crime (true or not) unless you *want* to chat
  with the feds.
- Harass or assault anyone.

Also, please try not to argue with the DEF CON Goons or the BSidesLV Staff.
Most of the time, you'll like stupid, and they usually have a good reason for
what they're asking you to do.  (Crowd control, fire code, etc.)

### Ask the Panel: What's your favorite thing about Hacker Summer Camp? ###

What's your favorite thing about Hacker Summer Camp? What can you not miss or
just must do?

**Matir**: The IoT village is one of my favorite places to hang out and meet
people with similar interests.  I'm also on staff for the Pros vs Joes CTF at
BSides Las Vegas, so you'll find me there during BSidesLV.  I'll also always
make the Dual Core performance at DEF CON, and sometimes some of int0x80's side
performances at other events. (I don't deny it, I'm a bit of a fanboy.)

**fadec0d3**: Don’t miss the workshops & villages.

**itsc0rg1**: Conversations / Contests.

**dissect0r**: I try to swing past *every* hacker village at least once, but
usually several times.  Sometimes there are unique and interesting things going
on or fun people participating in the village when you least expect it.  And I
always bring a lot of cash for the vendor area — every year there seems to be a
handful of devices that everyone wants, and sometimes stock clears out fast!  I
always throw down a lot of money on hardware and new gadgets or tools.

**Anonymous**: My favorite part is learning new things. I try to challenge
myself as much as possible to learn something new every year, whether it's
soldering (DEF CON XX), a new attack technique, or starting a new programming
language. In many cases it's not something I use again, but I can at least say
I've tried it. I absolutely can't miss the Dual Core performance.

## What to Bring ##

What you should or should not bring with you is also a surprisingly divisive
topic.  I'll begin by admitting that I'm a bit of a pack rat and tend to bring
everything I could possibly want to have with me.  (Ok, maybe not quite that
bad, but I still tend to bring far more than necessary.)  Others prefer a much
more minimalist approach.  Both probably work out well for different
individuals.  (Or maybe I'm quite unreasonable about what I bring.)

### Electronics ###

The DEF CON network is often described as "the most dangerous network in the
world".  While I think this overstates the risks (by quite a bit, actually), it
makes sense to take precautions and to consider the network a hostile network.
(Though you really should think of any network you don't control as a hostile
network.)

Some will suggest that you leave all your electronics at home (or at least in
your room) and spend your time doing things that require your in-person presence
(meeting people, hands-on activities, etc.).  This is not a bad idea, but I
think almost everyone will end up carrying at least a cell phone with them, even if
only to stay in touch with friends.

When it comes to laptops, there are two questions to be answered: will you bring
one with you at all, and if so, will you carry it with you daily?

I think most will end up bringing a laptop.  Some might feel comfortable
bringing their everyday laptop, and I've done that before (after swapping out the SSD
for one with an alternate image to protect my data, just in case).  This year,
however, I'll be carrying a Chromebook -- the Asus C302CA with Crouton
installed.  If all you need is internet access, a Chromebook offers the highest
level of security while on a hostile network.  Placing it in developer mode does
reduce the security guarantees somewhat, but also allows you to run Crouton,
which gives a more or less fully functional Debian Linux chroot.  You can also
run Debian derivatives like Kali, which is what I do, since I will use the
device for CTFs and contests.

If you're not going to participate in a contest or activity that requires the
use of a laptop, I encourage you to leave it in your hotel room safe.  (Yes, I
acknowledge that carrying it with you is a better mitigation against evil maid
attacks, but if you're that paranoid, you're probably already aware of that.)
There's no sense in carrying extra weight and hopefully you'll be spending your
time doing interactive things instead of staring at a laptop screen.

Once you've decided what you'll bring, you should take some reasonable steps to
secure your electronics.

On all devices, you should setup a VPN service (either commercial or your own)
and use it at all times.  I even use it over the cellular network because of the
rumors of Stingrays and Rogue Cell Towers.  (Yes, if the operator of those
devices has an 0-day for your baseband, you're still screwed.)  You should also
ensure that all devices are using a password for login and lock after going to
screensaver/sleep mode.

If you connect to the conference WiFi, connect to the "secure" DEF CON network
that uses 802.1x authentication.  If you've setup the proper certificate, this
should make it very difficult for someone to create a rogue AP.  This network
also does not allow client-to-client traffic, so should be reasonably secure
against too much malicious activity.  You'll still want to use the VPN though.

For cell phones, use a phone with the latest Android or iOS build, or bring a
burner phone (i.e., one with no data that you care about).  Make sure it's fully
patched before you leave home, and don't accept updates that may appear while at
con.  Enable device encryption and at least a strong PIN (if not password) to
unlock the screen.  It is exceedingly unlikely that someone will waste an iOS or
Android 0-day to pop random phones while at the conference.

For laptops, the advice is similar.  You should be fully patched and enable
full-disk encryption.  Turn on a software firewall, dropping all incoming
connections.  Set a BIOS/UEFI administrator password.  When it's not in your
posession, at least put it in your room safe.  (This is more about theft than
about hacking, but it's a good idea either way.)
