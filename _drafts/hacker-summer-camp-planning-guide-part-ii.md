In February, I wrote a [guide to planning travel for BSides, Black Hat, and DEF
CON](/2016/02/18/hacker-summer-camp-planning-guide.html), occasionally referred
to as "Hacker Summer Camp."  In my original post, I promised an update with
information about your actual travels to BSides, Black Hat, and DEF CON: what to
bring, what to do, and how best to stay out of trouble.  This is my best advice
on that, but I'm sure others have differing opinions.

### Health and Safety ###

I discussed the idea of managing your energy in the first post, but I can't
stress enough how important that is.  Las Vegas is hot, there's a lot going on,
and so it's easy to not realize how much you've burned yourself out.  Take your
time and don't try to do everything -- it's not possible and you'll make
yourself sick in the process.

DEF CON 101 attendees will hear about the "3-2-1" rule.  No, it's not some new
variation on the TSA's 3-1-1 rule, it's the guideline for personal survival at
DEF CON: 3 hours of sleep, 2 meals, and 1 shower.  Per day.  **Every day.**
Please follow at least this!  Many days you may want to shower more than once,
and I'd strongly encourage that -- you'll be packed into rooms with 15,000 of
your (soon to be) closest friends, and there's nothing that will make it harder
to network and meet people than smelling like a gym with no ventilation.  So I
will also add: use deodorant.  If you start to smell, take a shower, don't just
try to cover it up with some kind of body spray.  Body spray just means you
smell like sweat *and* some $4.99 crap you got from the checkout register.

This is a good time to mention hydration: it's Las Vegas, which means it will be
dry *and* hot, which is the recipe for dehydration.  So is moving around a lot.
So you need to always be drinking, and I don't just mean Beer, Gin & Tonic, or
Vodka & Red Bull.  Drink lots of water.  If at any point you get headaches,
nauseated, or generally feel like crap, odds are you're dehydrated and water
will help.  **Money saving tip:** if you want bottled water, buy water from
a drugstore or convenience
store on the strip (or if you're driving, bring it with you).  It will be
**much** cheaper than buying it in any of the hotels.

Finally, a word about physical safety: keep your wits about you.  DEF CON gets
attendees of all sorts, and you're in Las Vegas, a city known for clueless
tourists, so there's plenty of opportunity for thieves and other criminals.
Know where your stuff is at all times, and don't leave it unattended.  Don't
look like a conference attendee outside the hotel, and if you're out very late
at night, being with others will help ensure your safety.

### What to Bring ###

**What to Wear**

Read the weather forecast, but you can pretty much count on hot & dry.  And when
I say hot, I mean like 40&deg;C (100&deg;F +, for those of you not working in SI
units).  DEF CON is a *highly* informal conference -- t-shirts and shorts or
jeans are probably the "average" attire.  If you want to look more professional,
you'll be fine too, unless you wear a suit.  Then you'll stick out like a sore
thumb.  BSides is approximately the same, Black Hat tends more towards business
casual, though you'll see plenty of t-shirts & jeans here too.  Generally, wear
whatever your comfortable in in hot weather.

**What to leave at home **
