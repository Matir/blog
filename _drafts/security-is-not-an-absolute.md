If there's one thing I wish people from outside the security industry knew when
dealing with information security, it's that **Security is not an absolute**.
Most of the time, it's not even quantifiable.  Even in the case of particular
threat models, it's often impossible to make statements about the security of a
system with certainty.

At work, I deal with a lot of very smart people who are not "security people",
but are well-meaning and trying to do the right thing.  Online, I sometimes find
myself in conversations on [/r/netsec](https://reddit.com/r/netsec),
[/r/netsecstudents](https://reddit.com/r/netsecstudents),
[/r/asknetsec](https://reddit.com/r/asknetsec), or
[security.stackexchange](https://security.stackexchange.com) where someone wants
to know something about information security.  Either way, it's quite common
that someone asks the fateful question: "Is this secure?".  There are actually
only two answers to this question, and neither one is "Yes."
