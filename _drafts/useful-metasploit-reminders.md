This isn't an intro to metasploit, but more a reminder to myself of things that
are useful to know, but maybe not used all the time (or relatively new).

## Meterpreter ##

* [Reliable
communications](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Meterpreter-Reliable-Network-Communication)
are now a thing in meterpreter.
* [Transports](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Meterpreter-Transport-Control)
are useful for maintaining persistent connections: if your connection is lost, it will retry.
