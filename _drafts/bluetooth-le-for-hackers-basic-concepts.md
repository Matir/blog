This is the first post in a series on Bluetooth Low Energy for hackers.  I am no
expert in Bluetooth or BLE, but I'm taking a hands-on approach to learning about
it, and I decided to document my lessons as I go along.  There seems to be
relatively little information out there for hackers trying to play with or break
Bluetooth LE-based systems, so I'm going to try to consolidate what little there
is and add my own notes as I go.  Feel free to reach out if you find any errors
or have any suggestions for improvements.
