GnuPG is a GPL-licensed implementation of the OpenPGP standard, first popularized by free (as in beer) and commercial implementations known as PGP. GPG is used in encrypted e-mail, signed documents, software package management, and even for SSH authentication. If you are interested in protecting your privacy, your identity, your software downloads, or in using one tool to manage SSH keys and digital signatures, come and see how GPG can help you meet your goals. We'll also talk about best practices and options for using hardware smartcards to protect your keys in your GPG usage.
