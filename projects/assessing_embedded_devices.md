title: "Assessing the Embedded Devices on Your Network"
date: 2017-02-13
---

Embedded devices (including the so-called Internet of Things) pose unique
problems for those responsible for managing and assessing their security.  The
devices tend to be less transparent and more tightly integrated than typical
software and generally lack the host-based security controls (privilege
separation, host firewalls, etc.) found on desktop or server applications.  This
talk will cover some of the unique constraints for threat modeling and assessing
these devices, then walk through an assessment of a VoIP phone and discuss the
issues found there, including potential mitigations that can be applied if a
device cannot be updated.

This is a talk I gave at BSidesSF 2017.
