The Secure Shell, or SSH, is a powerful communications tool most often used for securely accessing a command-line session on a remote system.  As essential as that functionality is, there is much more to SSH than that. This talk will introduce SSH, and discuss integral applications including secure file transfer, accessing services behind a firewall, and running graphical applications software remotely.  Specific topics include:

Starting with SSH
SSH Keys
Secure File Copying (SCP)
Port Forwarding
X11 Forwarding
Advanced SSH options and functions
 

This version (for the ALE Central meeting) of the presentation is updated and expanded from the original, ALE-NW, version.

Original Version

This is a short introduction to the power of SSH.  Presented at the inaugural meeting of the ALE-NW group at Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU).
