title: Test Interface for Multiple Embedded Protocols

The Test Interface for Multiple Embedded Protocols (TIMEP)
is an Open Source Hardware board based around the FTDI FT2232H chip to
provide breakouts, buffering, and level conversion for a number of common
embedded hardware interfaces.  At present, this includes:

* SPI
* I2C
* JTAG
* SWD
* UART

It's intended to be easy to use and work with open source software, including
tools like OpenOCD and Flashrom.
